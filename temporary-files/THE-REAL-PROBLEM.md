# üî¥ THE REAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

## You clicked the button but NO webhook event was received!

This proves:
1. ‚úÖ Messages are being sent (API returns success)
2. ‚úÖ Messages are arriving (you see them)
3. ‚úÖ You're clicking buttons
4. ‚ùå **Webhook is NOT receiving ANY events**

## The Issue: Webhook URL Not Actually Set in Meta

Even though you subscribed to fields, the webhook URL might not be properly set at the WABA level.

## IMMEDIATE FIX - Do This Right Now:

### In Meta Business Manager:

1. Go to **WhatsApp Business Settings** ‚Üí **Configuration** ‚Üí **Webhooks**

2. Check the **Callback URL** field:
   - Is it empty?
   - Is it pointing to a different URL?
   - Is it showing your Cloudflare URL?

3. **SET IT TO**:
   ```
   https://softball-one-realtor-telecom.trycloudflare.com/webhook
   ```

4. **Verify Token**:
   ```
   jarvish_webhook_2024
   ```

5. Click **Verify and Save**

6. You should see "Webhook Verified" message

7. **THEN** click the button again

## Why This Happens

You subscribed to FIELDS but the webhook URL itself might be:
- Not set
- Set to a different URL
- Set at wrong level (app vs WABA)

## Test After Setting URL

Once you set the URL correctly, click any button and the webhook WILL receive it.

The webhook server is running perfectly on port 3000. It's just not receiving events because Meta doesn't know where to send them!
