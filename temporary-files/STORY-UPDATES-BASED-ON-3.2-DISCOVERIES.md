        { text: 'ðŸ“¸ Get Images', payload: 'UNLOCK_IMAGES' },
        { text: 'ðŸ“¹ Get Videos', payload: 'UNLOCK_VIDEOS' },  // NEW
        { text: 'ðŸ“Š Get Updates', payload: 'UNLOCK_UPDATES' }
    ]
};

// Webhook handler for video delivery
if (buttonId === 'UNLOCK_VIDEOS') {
    const videos = await getAdvisorVideos(message.from);
    for (const video of videos) {
        await sendVideo(message.from, video.url, video.caption);
    }
}
```

## Story 4.2: Production Monitoring Dashboard

### Current Focus

### Enhancements from Story 3.2
The webhook provides real-time data that the dashboard should display:

```javascript
// New dashboard widgets from webhook data
const webhookMetrics = {
    daily_button_clicks: {
        'UNLOCK_IMAGES': 145,
        'UNLOCK_CONTENT': 89,
        'UNLOCK_UPDATES': 203
    },
    chat_interactions: 67,
    response_times: {
        button_response: '1.2s avg',
        chat_response: '2.4s avg'
    },
    active_conversations: 12
};
```

## Story 4.3: WhatsApp Web-Style Interface

### Current Focus
WhatsApp Web-like interface for viewing all advisor conversations

### Enhancements from Story 3.2
The webhook already receives and processes all messages, making this interface much easier to build:

```javascript
// Webhook stores all interactions
const conversationData = {
    advisor_phone: '919022810769',
    messages: [
        {
            type: 'utility_template',
            sent_at: '2025-09-11 05:00:00',
            content: 'Your daily content is ready',
            buttons_shown: ['Get Images', 'Get Content']
        },
        {
            type: 'button_click',
            clicked_at: '2025-09-11 09:30:00',
            button: 'UNLOCK_IMAGES',
            content_delivered: ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg']
        },
        {
            type: 'text_message',
            received_at: '2025-09-11 10:15:00',
            content: 'What are today\'s market levels?',
            ai_response: 'Nifty is at 19,800...'
        }
    ]
};
```

7. **Add Task**: Create conversation export that includes button events
8. **Benefit**: Complete conversation history including all interactions

## New Story Proposal: 4.4 - Intelligent Analytics & Insights

### Based on Story 3.2 Discoveries
With the Click-to-Unlock strategy and CRM tracking, we have rich data for analytics:

```markdown
# Story 4.4: Intelligent Analytics & Insights Dashboard

## Story
**As a** business owner,
**I want** detailed analytics on advisor engagement patterns and content effectiveness,
**so that** I can optimize content strategy and identify high-performing advisors

## Key Metrics from Story 3.2
1. Button click rates by type (Images vs Content vs Updates)
2. Time-to-click distribution (how long after 5 AM do advisors engage)
3. Chat interaction frequency and topics
4. Content delivery success rates
5. Advisor engagement scores
6. AI response effectiveness metrics

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard showing Click-to-Unlock engagement funnel
2. Heatmap of advisor activity by time of day
3. Content performance metrics (which content gets clicked most)
4. AI chat conversation quality scores
5. Advisor segmentation based on engagement patterns
6. Predictive analytics for advisor churn
7. A/B testing framework for button text/content
8. Weekly engagement reports auto-generated
```

## Implementation Priority Recommendations

### Based on Story 3.2 Infrastructure
1. **Complete Story 3.2 first** - Webhook is foundation for all real-time features
2. **Story 4.3 next** - Easiest to build with webhook data already flowing
3. **Story 4.2 enhanced** - Add webhook monitoring to dashboard
4. **Story 4.1 with Click-to-Unlock** - Video delivery via buttons
5. **Story 4.4 new** - Analytics once enough data collected

## Technical Dependencies Map

```

## Database Schema Implications

### New Tables Needed from Story 3.2
```sql
-- Button interactions table
CREATE TABLE button_clicks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    advisor_phone VARCHAR(20),
    button_id VARCHAR(50),
    clicked_at TIMESTAMP,
    content_delivered JSON,
    session_id VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Chat conversations table
CREATE TABLE chat_messages (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    advisor_phone VARCHAR(20),
    message_type ENUM('user', 'ai'),
    content TEXT,
    context JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Webhook events table
CREATE TABLE webhook_events (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    event_type VARCHAR(50),
    payload JSON,
    processed BOOLEAN,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Key Insights from Story 3.2 Thread

### What We Learned
1. **UTILITY templates are golden** - No limits, buttons work forever
2. **Webhook differentiates interactions** - Critical for CRM
3. **Claude on VM saves money** - No external API costs
4. **Infrastructure complexity** - HTTPS required, tunnels bad
5. **User expectations** - Full automation, zero manual work

### What This Means for Future Stories
- All content delivery should use Click-to-Unlock pattern
- Real-time features are now possible with webhook
- Rich analytics data available from button clicks
- AI-powered interactions create new possibilities
- Infrastructure is production-ready for scale

## Risk Mitigation Updates

### Based on Story 3.2 Experiences
1. **Always use floating IPs** - Prevent URL changes
2. **Domain + SSL required** - Meta won't accept otherwise
3. **Snapshot VMs regularly** - Recovery from accidents
4. **Document everything** - Complex infrastructure needs docs
5. **Test Meta requirements** - They change without notice

## Conclusion

Story 3.2's Click-to-Unlock strategy and webhook infrastructure fundamentally enhance the platform's capabilities. All future stories (4.1, 4.2, 4.3) should be updated to leverage these new features:

1. **Button-based content delivery** - Better UX than text commands
2. **Real-time event processing** - Enables live dashboards
3. **CRM conversation tracking** - Rich data for analytics
4. **AI-powered responses** - Intelligent interactions

The webhook is the foundation that makes everything else more powerful.
