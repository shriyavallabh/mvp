## The Core Issue

Your webhook isn't receiving button clicks because of Meta's webhook hierarchy. Even though you configured the webhook at WABA level, there might be conflicts or missing subscriptions.

## Complete Fix Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ mTLS Configuration (Answer to Your Question)

**Should you enable "Attach a client certificate to Webhook requests"?**

**Answer: NO** - Keep it OFF for now

Reasons:
- mTLS adds complexity that's not needed for basic webhook functionality
- It requires your server to verify Meta's client certificate
- Only enable if you need extra security for sensitive data
- Your current issue is not related to mTLS

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Correct Webhook Configuration in Meta

Go to Meta Business Manager and configure EXACTLY like this:

#### A. Remove ALL Phone-Level Webhooks
1. Go to each phone number's settings
2. Remove any webhook URLs configured at phone level
3. This includes all 3 numbers:
   - Test Number (+1 555 018 8463)
   - The Skin Rules (+91 90224 73943)
   - Your Jarvis Daily Assistant (+91 76666 84471)

#### B. Configure ONLY at WABA Level
1. Go to: **WhatsApp Business Settings** ‚Üí **Configuration** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
2. Select Product: **WhatsApp Business Account** (NOT Application)
3. Configure:
   ```
   Callback URL: https://softball-one-realtor-telecom.trycloudflare.com/webhook
   Verify Token: jarvish_webhook_2024
   ```
4. Click **Verify and Save**

#### C. Subscribe to Fields (CRITICAL)
After saving, you MUST subscribe to these fields:
- ‚úÖ **messages** (REQUIRED for button clicks)
- ‚úÖ **message_status**
- ‚úÖ **message_template_status_update**

Click the **Subscribe** button next to each field!

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Why Button Clicks Aren't Working - The Real Reasons

1. **Field Not Subscribed**: The "messages" field might show as configured but not actually subscribed
2. **Webhook Priority**: Phone-level webhooks override WABA webhooks
3. **Product Selection**: You must select "WhatsApp Business Account" product, not "Application"
4. **Interactive Message Format**: Buttons must be type "reply" with unique IDs

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Fix

After configuration, test with this exact sequence:

1. Send a new interactive message with button
2. Click the button
3. Watch webhook logs: `tail -f webhook.log`
4. You should see the event arrive
