93% of F&O traders lost money last year.

But here's the data nobody shows you:

The 7% who made money?
Average profit: â‚¹2.8 lakhs per year.

The 93% who lost money?
Average loss: â‚¹1.2 lakhs per year.

Do the math:
â€¢ Total winnings: â‚¹1,960 crores
â€¢ Total losses: â‚¹11,160 crores
â€¢ Net wealth destroyed: â‚¹9,200 crores

That's more than Paytm's market cap. Gone. Forever.

But the real kicker?

Those 7% winners?
â€¢ 15+ years of experience
â€¢ Risk management systems
â€¢ Never trade with emotions
â€¢ Have other income sources

The 93% losers?
â€¢ Started trading in lockdown
â€¢ Follow Telegram tips
â€¢ YOLO mentality
â€¢ "Main alag hun" (I'm different)

Zerodha's data shows:
Day traders: 89% lose money
Swing traders: 80% lose money
Long-term SIP investors: 87% make money

The same market.
The same stocks.
Opposite results.

Yet every day, I see posts:
"Made â‚¹50K in F&O today! ðŸš€"

Nobody posts:
"Lost â‚¹2 lakhs this month ðŸ˜¢"

Survivorship bias is a brutal teacher.

Your money. Your choice.
But don't say the data didn't warn you.

P.S. That 93% statistic?
It gets worse every year.
Not better.
