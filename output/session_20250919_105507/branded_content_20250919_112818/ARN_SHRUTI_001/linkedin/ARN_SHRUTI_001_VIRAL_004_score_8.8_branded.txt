Your daily ₹200 coffee just cost you ₹67 lakhs.

Confused? Let me break it down:

Daily coffee: ₹200
Monthly: ₹6,000
Yearly: ₹72,000

If invested in SIP for 20 years at 12% returns:
Final amount: ₹67,21,956

But wait, there's more:

That same ₹6,000 monthly for 30 years?
₹2.1 CRORES

Your Starbucks habit = Someone's retirement fund.

"But coffee gives me energy!"

So does compound interest.
For 30 years.

Real examples from my client data:
• Anil (stopped smoking): ₹4K/month → ₹1.2 Cr in 25 years
• Priya (home cooking): ₹8K/month → ₹2.4 Cr in 25 years
• Rahul (cancelled Netflix): ₹500/month → ₹15 L in 25 years

The formula is simple:
Small sacrifice today = Big wealth tomorrow

But here's the twist:

After 10 years of SIP,
Your portfolio will generate enough
To buy 100 cups of coffee daily.

From your dividends alone.

So choose:
20 years of coffee
OR
Lifetime of coffee money

Your taste buds decide today.
Your bank account pays tomorrow.

P.S. Black coffee at home costs ₹5.
Same caffeine. Better wealth.

What's your ₹200 daily habit?
