  "content": "The auto driver who taught me about compound interest.\n\nMumbai. 2019. Rain-soaked evening.\n\nAuto driver: \"Saheb, aap investment karte ho?\" (Sir, do you invest?)\n\nMe: \"Haan, main financial advisor hun\" (Yes, I'm a financial advisor)\n\nHim: \"Main bhi karta hun. Dekho.\" (I also invest. Look.)\n\nShows me his phone:\nSIP amount: ₹3,000\nCurrent value: ₹7.8 lakhs\nYears: 6\n\nI was shocked.\n\n\"Kaise seekha?\" (How did you learn?)\n\n\"YouTube. Rachana madam ke videos.\"\n(YouTube. Rachana madam's videos)\n\nThis man, earning ₹800-1200 daily,\nWas more disciplined than my MBA clients.\n\nEvery 1st of the month:\nRain or shine. Festivals or emergencies.\n₹3,000. Without fail.\n\n\"Saheb, main bachpan se dekha hai...\nPapa ne kabhi save nahi kiya.\nHamesha hand-to-mouth.\nMain different hun.\"\n(Sir, I've seen since childhood... Papa never saved. Always hand-to-mouth. I'm different.)\n\n2024 update:\nCurrent value: ₹18.6 lakhs\nMonthly SIP: ₹5,000\nGoal: Son's engineering\n\nHis philosophy:\n\"Meter down hoga, market up-down hoga.\nBas SIP chalte rehna chahiye.\"\n(Meter will go down, market will fluctuate. Just keep the SIP running.)\n\nThe millionaire mindset?\nIsn't about salary.\nIt's about starting.\n\nThat auto ride cost me ₹120.\nThe lesson? Priceless.\n\nWho's your financial guru?",
