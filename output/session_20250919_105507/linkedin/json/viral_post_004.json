Let me break it down:\n\nDaily coffee: ₹200\nMonthly: ₹6,000\nYearly: ₹72,000\n\nIf invested in SIP for 20 years at 12% returns:\nFinal amount: ₹67,21,956\n\nBut wait, there's more:\n\nThat same ₹6,000 monthly for 30 years?\n₹2.1 CRORES\n\nYour Starbucks habit = Someone's retirement fund.\n\n\"But coffee gives me energy!\"\n\nSo does compound interest.\nFor 30 years.\n\nReal examples from my client data:\n• Anil (stopped smoking): ₹4K/month → ₹1.2 Cr in 25 years\n• Priya (home cooking): ₹8K/month → ₹2.4 Cr in 25 years\n• Rahul (cancelled Netflix): ₹500/month → ₹15 L in 25 years\n\nThe formula is simple:\nSmall sacrifice today = Big wealth tomorrow\n\nBut here's the twist:\n\nAfter 10 years of SIP,\nYour portfolio will generate enough\nTo buy 100 cups of coffee daily.\n\nFrom your dividends alone.\n\nSo choose:\n20 years of coffee\nOR\nLifetime of coffee money\n\nYour taste buds decide today.\nYour bank account pays tomorrow.\n\nP.S. Black coffee at home costs ₹5.\nSame caffeine. Better wealth.\n\nWhat's your ₹200 daily habit?",
