High valuations (PE: 22 vs historical 16)\n2. FII selling (‚Çπ85K crores outflow)\n3. Expensive everything (Cars, homes, stocks)\n\nBut here's the contrarian opportunity:\n\nWhen economy grows faster than markets,\nEventually markets catch up.\n\nAlways.\n\nExamples:\n‚Ä¢ China 2000-2010: Economy boomed, markets flat ‚Üí Then 500% rally\n‚Ä¢ USA 1970-1980: GDP grew, stocks flat ‚Üí Then 20-year bull run\n‚Ä¢ Japan 1950-1960: Same pattern\n\nThe Indian playbook:\n‚úÖ Keep investing through underperformance\n‚úÖ DCA into quality stocks/funds\n‚úÖ Wait for valuation-growth alignment\n\nTimeline? 2-3 years max.\n\nBecause when a ‚Çπ331 lakh crore economy\nFinally gets fairly valued in markets...\n\nThat's when generational wealth is made.\n\nToday's \"expensive\" market\nWill look cheap in 2027.\n\nHistory doesn't repeat.\nBut it rhymes.\n\nAnd right now, it's humming\nThe tune of opportunity.\n\nJai Hind. Jai SIP.\n\nAre you buying the dip in confidence?",
