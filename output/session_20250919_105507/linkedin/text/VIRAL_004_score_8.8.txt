Your daily ‚Çπ200 coffee just cost you ‚Çπ67 lakhs.

Confused? Let me break it down:

Daily coffee: ‚Çπ200
Monthly: ‚Çπ6,000
Yearly: ‚Çπ72,000

If invested in SIP for 20 years at 12% returns:
Final amount: ‚Çπ67,21,956

But wait, there's more:

That same ‚Çπ6,000 monthly for 30 years?
‚Çπ2.1 CRORES

Your Starbucks habit = Someone's retirement fund.

"But coffee gives me energy!"

So does compound interest.
For 30 years.

Real examples from my client data:
‚Ä¢ Anil (stopped smoking): ‚Çπ4K/month ‚Üí ‚Çπ1.2 Cr in 25 years
‚Ä¢ Priya (home cooking): ‚Çπ8K/month ‚Üí ‚Çπ2.4 Cr in 25 years
‚Ä¢ Rahul (cancelled Netflix): ‚Çπ500/month ‚Üí ‚Çπ15 L in 25 years

The formula is simple:
Small sacrifice today = Big wealth tomorrow

But here's the twist:

After 10 years of SIP,
Your portfolio will generate enough
To buy 100 cups of coffee daily.

From your dividends alone.

So choose:
20 years of coffee
OR
Lifetime of coffee money

Your taste buds decide today.
Your bank account pays tomorrow.

P.S. Black coffee at home costs ‚Çπ5.
Same caffeine. Better wealth.

What's your ‚Çπ200 daily habit?
