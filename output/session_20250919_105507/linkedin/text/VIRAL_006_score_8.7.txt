India just became the 4th largest economy.

We beat Japan.

But here's the part media won't tell you:

Our stock market is UNDERPERFORMING.

The math doesn't add up:

🇮🇳 India GDP: ₹331 lakh crores (4th globally)
📈 Sensex returns 2024: +12%
🌏 Global markets 2024: +18%

We're growing faster than the world.
But our markets are growing slower.

Why?

1. High valuations (PE: 22 vs historical 16)
2. FII selling (₹85K crores outflow)
3. Expensive everything (Cars, homes, stocks)

But here's the contrarian opportunity:

When economy grows faster than markets,
Eventually markets catch up.

Always.

Examples:
• China 2000-2010: Economy boomed, markets flat → Then 500% rally
• USA 1970-1980: GDP grew, stocks flat → Then 20-year bull run
• Japan 1950-1960: Same pattern

The Indian playbook:
✅ Keep investing through underperformance
✅ DCA into quality stocks/funds
✅ Wait for valuation-growth alignment

Timeline? 2-3 years max.

Because when a ₹331 lakh crore economy
Finally gets fairly valued in markets...

That's when generational wealth is made.

Today's "expensive" market
Will look cheap in 2027.

History doesn't repeat.
But it rhymes.

And right now, it's humming
The tune of opportunity.

Jai Hind. Jai SIP.

Are you buying the dip in confidence?
