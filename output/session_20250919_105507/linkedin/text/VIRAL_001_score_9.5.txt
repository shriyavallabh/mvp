I met a farmer in Punjab with ‚Çπ2.8 crores in his savings account.

His monthly income? ‚Çπ18,000.

How did Harpal Singh become a crorepati?

1996: Started ‚Çπ500 monthly SIP
"Saheb, bank wale kya bolenge?" (What will the bank people say?)

2008: Crisis hit. Everyone panicked.
Harpal increased SIP to ‚Çπ1,000.
"Sasta mil raha hai" (It's getting cheaper)

2015: Doubled to ‚Çπ2,000
"Puttar nu padhana hai" (Have to educate my son)

2024: ‚Çπ5,000 monthly
Total invested: ‚Çπ8.4 lakhs
Current value: ‚Çπ2.8 crores

His secret?
"Main bas line lagata raha" (I just kept fishing)

While we debated market timing on Twitter,
Harpal was buying every month for 28 years.

Today, his village calls him "Crorepati Uncle."
His response: "Koi rocket science nahi hai" (It's not rocket science)

The man who couldn't operate a smartphone
Beat 99% of "smart" investors.

Your excuse is what exactly?

P.S. He still lives in the same house.
Drives the same Activa.
But sleeps peacefully.

Can you?
