The auto driver who taught me about compound interest.

Mumbai. 2019. Rain-soaked evening.

Auto driver: "Saheb, aap investment karte ho?" (Sir, do you invest?)

Me: "Haan, main financial advisor hun" (Yes, I'm a financial advisor)

Him: "Main bhi karta hun. Dekho." (I also invest. Look.)

Shows me his phone:
SIP amount: ₹3,000
Current value: ₹7.8 lakhs
Years: 6

I was shocked.

"Kaise seekha?" (How did you learn?)

"YouTube. Rachana madam ke videos."
(YouTube. Rachana madam's videos)

This man, earning ₹800-1200 daily,
Was more disciplined than my MBA clients.

Every 1st of the month:
Rain or shine. Festivals or emergencies.
₹3,000. Without fail.

"Saheb, main bachpan se dekha hai...
Papa ne kabhi save nahi kiya.
Hamesha hand-to-mouth.
Main different hun."
(Sir, I've seen since childhood... Papa never saved. Always hand-to-mouth. I'm different.)

2024 update:
Current value: ₹18.6 lakhs
Monthly SIP: ₹5,000
Goal: Son's engineering

His philosophy:
"Meter down hoga, market up-down hoga.
Bas SIP chalte rehna chahiye."
(Meter will go down, market will fluctuate. Just keep the SIP running.)

The millionaire mindset?
Isn't about salary.
It's about starting.

That auto ride cost me ₹120.
The lesson? Priceless.

Who's your financial guru?
