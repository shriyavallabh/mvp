      "content": "I lost ₹15 lakhs in 2008.\n\nEveryone said \"Market will recover.\"\nIt did. But I had already sold at loss.\n\nToday at Sensex 83014, I see the same fear in clients' eyes.\n\nHere's what 2008 taught me that nobody talks about:\n\n1. The market crashed 60%\n   → But SIP investors made 127% returns by 2010\n\n2. Panicked sellers lost ₹4.6 lakh crores\n   → Patient investors gained ₹12 lakh crores\n\n3. IT stocks everyone hated at ₹200\n   → Trading at ₹1,800 today\n\nThe brutal truth?\n\nYour emotions are your portfolio's biggest enemy.\nNot the market. Not inflation. Not even bad stocks.\n\nWhen IT is up +4.41% today, everyone's buying.\nBut real wealth? It's made when everyone's selling.\n\nMy ₹15 lakh loss became my ₹2 crore lesson.\n\nWhat's yours?\n\nP.S. Still have the screenshot of that loss.\nKeeps me humble. And rich.\n\nVidyadhar Petkar | Your Financial Growth Partner\nARN: ARN-138924\n\nMutual fund investments are subject to market risks.

I didn't.\n\nStarted his SIP: ₹500.\nIncreased to ₹1,000 in 2014.\nThen ₹2,000 in 2016.\nNow: ₹5,000 monthly.\n\n12 years later:\n• Invested: ₹3.6 lakhs\n• Current value: ₹47 lakhs\n• His daughter: Studying engineering\n\nThe elite will tell you \"need ₹1 lakh to start.\"\n\nRaju proved them wrong.\n\nYour excuse is what exactly?\n\nWith Sensex at 83014 and TCS leading IT gains at +4.41%, opportunities are everywhere.\n\nStart today.

      "content": "STOP buying when markets are at 83014.\n\nHere's why I'm telling my clients the OPPOSITE of what everyone else is saying.\n\nData from last 20 years:\n\nWhen Sensex crossed 80,000:\n→ 73% investors bought heavily\n→ 89% regretted it within 6 months\n\nWhen Sensex was at 50,000 (COVID crash):\n→ Only 8% had courage to buy\n→ They made 65% returns in 2 years\n\nToday's reality:\n• IT sector: +4.41% (everyone's euphoric)\n• FII inflow: Record high (greed indicator)\n• P/E ratios: Above historical average\n\nWhat I'm doing differently:\n\n1. NOT stopping SIPs (discipline > timing)\n2. Booking partial profits in overheated sectors\n3. Building cash for the next correction\n4. Increasing allocation to undervalued sectors\n\nContrarian thinking made Warren Buffett $100 billion.\nFollowing the crowd made people broke.\n\nWhich side are you on?\n\nVidyadhar Petkar | Building Wealth Through Discipline\nARN: ARN-138924\n\nPast performance is not indicative of future results.
