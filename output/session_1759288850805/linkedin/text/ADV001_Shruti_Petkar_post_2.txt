₹500 monthly SIP started by a rickshaw driver.

Today: ₹47 lakhs.

I met Raju in 2012. Monthly income: ₹8,000.
"Saheb, can I also invest?"

Everyone laughed. I didn't.

Started his SIP: ₹500.
Increased to ₹1,000 in 2014.
Then ₹2,000 in 2016.
Now: ₹5,000 monthly.

12 years later:
• Invested: ₹3.6 lakhs
• Current value: ₹47 lakhs
• His daughter: Studying engineering

The elite will tell you "need ₹1 lakh to start."

Raju proved them wrong.

Your excuse is what exactly?

With Sensex at 83014 and TCS leading IT gains at +4.41%, opportunities are everywhere.

Start today. Start small. But START.
