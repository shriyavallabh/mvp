STOP buying when markets are at 83014.

Here's why I'm telling my clients the OPPOSITE of what everyone else is saying.

Data from last 20 years:

When Sensex crossed 80,000:
→ 73% investors bought heavily
→ 89% regretted it within 6 months

When Sensex was at 50,000 (COVID crash):
→ Only 8% had courage to buy
→ They made 65% returns in 2 years

Today's reality:
• IT sector: +4.41% (everyone's euphoric)
• FII inflow: Record high (greed indicator)
• P/E ratios: Above historical average

What I'm doing differently:

1. NOT stopping SIPs (discipline > timing)
2. Booking partial profits in overheated sectors
3. Building cash for the next correction
4. Increasing allocation to undervalued sectors

Contrarian thinking made Warren Buffett $100 billion.
Following the crowd made people broke.

Which side are you on?
