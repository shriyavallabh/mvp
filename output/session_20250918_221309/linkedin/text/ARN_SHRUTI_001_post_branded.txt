ðŸ“Š Market Insight: IT Sector Leads the Charge

The market's speaking volumes today, and savvy investors are listening.

ðŸ“ˆ KEY MOVERS:
â€¢ Sensex: 82,876 (+0.22%)
â€¢ Nifty IT: +4.41% - Best performer
â€¢ PSU Banks: Outperforming private peers

ðŸ’¡ STRATEGIC INSIGHT:
With RBI's rate cut to 5.5% and IT sector surging on global tech recovery, it's time to reassess your portfolio allocation.

For portfolios >â‚¹25L, consider:
â†’ 20-25% IT sector exposure
â†’ 15% PSU banks (asset quality improving)
â†’ 10% Pharma (defensive play with 12-15% growth expected)

The domestic institutional investors (DIIs) are now matching FII flows - a historic shift that signals confidence in India's growth story.
