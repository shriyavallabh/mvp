      "content": "I lost ₹15 lakhs in 2008.\n\nEveryone said \"Market will recover.\"\nIt did. But I had already sold at loss.\n\nToday at Sensex 82150, I see the same fear in clients' eyes.\n\nHere's what 2008 taught me that nobody talks about:\n\n1. The market crashed 60%\n   → But SIP investors made 127% returns by 2010\n\n2. Panicked sellers lost ₹4.6 lakh crores\n   → Patient investors gained ₹12 lakh crores\n\n3. IT stocks everyone hated at ₹200\n   → Trading at ₹1,800 today\n\nThe brutal truth?\n\nYour emotions are your portfolio's biggest enemy.\nNot the market. Not inflation. Not even bad stocks.\n\nWhen IT is up 2.8% today, everyone's buying.\nBut real wealth? It's made when everyone's selling.\n\nMy ₹15 lakh loss became my ₹2 crore lesson.\n\nWhat's yours?\n\nP.S. Still have the screenshot of that loss.\nKeeps me humble. And rich.\n\nShriya Vallabh Petkar | Empowering Financial Decisions\nARN: ARN-147852\n\nMutual fund investments are subject to market risks.
