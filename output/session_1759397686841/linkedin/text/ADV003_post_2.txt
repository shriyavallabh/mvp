₹5,000 monthly SIP started by a rickshaw driver.

Today: ₹47 lakhs.

I met Raju in 2012. Monthly income: ₹8,000.
"Saheb, can I also invest?"

Everyone laughed. I didn't.

Started his SIP: ₹500.
Increased to ₹1,000 in 2014.
Then ₹2,000 in 2016.
Now: ₹5,000 monthly.

12 years later:
• Invested: ₹3.6 lakhs
• Current value: ₹47 lakhs
• His daughter: Studying engineering

The elite will tell you "need ₹1 lakh to start."

Raju proved them wrong.

With IT sector exploding 2.8% today, imagine what disciplined SIPs can do for YOU.

Your excuse is what exactly?
