I lost ₹15 lakhs in 2008.

Everyone said "Market will recover."
It did. But I had already sold at loss.

Today at Sensex 82150, I see the same fear in clients' eyes.

Here's what 2008 taught me that nobody talks about:

1. The market crashed 60%
   → But SIP investors made 127% returns by 2010

2. Panicked sellers lost ₹4.6 lakh crores
   → Patient investors gained ₹12 lakh crores

3. IT stocks everyone hated at ₹200
   → Trading at ₹1,800 today

The brutal truth?

Your emotions are your portfolio's biggest enemy.
Not the market. Not inflation. Not even bad stocks.

When IT is up 2.8% today, everyone's buying.
But real wealth? It's made when everyone's selling.

My ₹15 lakh loss became my ₹2 crore lesson.

What's yours?

P.S. Still have the screenshot of that loss.
Keeps me humble. And rich.
