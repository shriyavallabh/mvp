ðŸš¨ IT sector just jumped 2.8% in a single day.

TCS: +4.8%
Infosys: +3.2%
Wipro: +2.9%

Here's your 3-step portfolio rebalancing playbook:

STEP 1: Book Partial Profits
If IT holdings are >15% of portfolio, book 30-40% profits
Lock in gains while momentum is strong

STEP 2: Rebalance to Defensives
Rotate into Pharma (+1.9%) and FMCG
Defensive sectors provide stability in volatile times

STEP 3: Maintain 15-20% Cash
Deploy in quality stocks during next correction
Opportunities emerge when others panic
