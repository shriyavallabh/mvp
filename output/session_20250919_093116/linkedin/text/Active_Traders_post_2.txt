Everyone's WRONG about IT stocks. Here's proof with data:

"IT is dead" they said.
IT index: Down 10% YTD.
Smart money: Selling.

But I found something NOBODY is talking about:

FACT 1: IT surged 2.3% yesterday
Hidden reason? Rupee crashed 1.7% this month.
Each 1% rupee fall = 50-60 bps margin expansion.

FACT 2: TCS market cap hit ₹15.44 LAKH CRORES
Bigger than Pakistan's entire GDP.
Still "undervalued" at 28x PE vs 35x in 2021.

FACT 3: Youth unemployment at 16.8%
But IT hiring silently resumed.
TCS alone: 40,000 freshers planned.

Here's the CONTRARIAN PLAY:

While everyone sells IT on "AI will kill jobs"...
Reality: AI needs MORE engineers, not less.

The data nobody sees:
• Dollar at 83.25 (worst rupee performance in Asia)
• IT gets 60% revenue in dollars
• Effective revenue boost: 8-10% FREE

Banking falling (-0.5%) → Money rotating to IT
Classic sector rotation most miss.

My position:
Long IT, Short Banks.
Time horizon: 6 months.
Target: 15-20% outperformance.

The crowd is ALWAYS wrong at inflection points.
2008: "IT is finished" → 300% returns by 2010
2025: "AI kills IT" → Watch what happens next.

What's your contrarian bet?
