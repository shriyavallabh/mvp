I lost ₹15 lakhs in 2008.

My wife didn't talk to me for 3 months.
My parents said "We told you so."
My friends? They disappeared.

Sensex crashed from 21,000 to 8,000.

I sold EVERYTHING.

Biggest mistake of my life?
No.
Best education I ever got.

Here's what that ₹15 lakh loss taught me:

LESSON 1: The market ALWAYS recovers
Sensex today: 83,014
My ₹15 lakhs would be worth ₹1.3 crores.
But I sold at the bottom.

LESSON 2: Your emotions are expensive
Fear cost me ₹1.15 crores (1.3cr - 15L).
Most expensive emotion I ever felt.

LESSON 3: Rich people buy during crashes
While I sold, they bought.
Same stocks. 75% discount.
Today they're billionaires.

LESSON 4: India's story is UNSTOPPABLE
2008: Nobody believed in India
2025: We're the 4th largest economy
We literally overtook JAPAN.

What I do differently now:

Crash = Shopping time.
Green days = Do nothing.
Red days = Buy quality.

My current portfolio:
Down 10%? I add more.
Up 50%? I hold.
Sideways? I wait.

That ₹15 lakh loss?
Made me ₹3.7 crores in the next decade.

Because I learned:
Wealth isn't made in bull markets.
It's made in BEAR markets.
You just collect it in bull markets.

Your losses aren't failures.
They're tuition fees.
The question is - are you learning?

P.S. Still have that 2008 portfolio screenshot.

My daily reminder: Patience pays in CRORES.
