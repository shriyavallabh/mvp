Your â‚¹10 morning chai tells you EVERYTHING about investing.

Yesterday: Chai = â‚¹8
Today: Chai = â‚¹10
Inflation: Just 2.1%

Wait, WHAT? ðŸ¤”

Here's the SECRET nobody explains properly:

Your chai inflated 25% in 2 years.
But official inflation? 2.1%.
Your SBI savings account? 2.5%.

The REAL story:

1. Gold jumped 176% (vs 2500/gram in 2015) in 10 years
   â†’ Your grandmother was right all along

2. Sensex crossed 83,014 yesterday
   â†’ But YOUR money is still in FD at 6.6%

3. That â‚¹500 you spend on chai monthly?
   â†’ Could become â‚¹18 lakhs in 25 years

Here's what rich people know that you don't:

They don't save money.
They GROW money.

While you worry about â‚¹100 here and there,
They put â‚¹100 to WORK.

Simple math:
â€¢ â‚¹10 daily on chai = â‚¹3,650/year
â€¢ Same in index fund = â‚¹42,000 in 10 years
â€¢ Keep buying chai = â‚¹36,500 spent, nothing gained

The chai wala understands inflation better than you.
He raised prices.
Did your salary increase 25%?

Start TODAY:
Skip one chai. Start one SIP.
Your future self will thank you with a Mercedes, not an auto.

What's your chai teaching you about money?
