Here's proof with data:\n\n\"IT is dead\" they said.\nIT index: Down 10% YTD.\nSmart money: Selling.\n\nBut I found something NOBODY is talking about:\n\nFACT 1: IT surged 2.3% yesterday\nHidden reason? Rupee crashed 1.7% this month.\nEach 1% rupee fall = 50-60 bps margin expansion.\n\nFACT 2: TCS market cap hit â‚¹15.44 LAKH CRORES\nBigger than Pakistan's entire GDP.\nStill \"undervalued\" at 28x PE vs 35x in 2021.\n\nFACT 3: Youth unemployment at 16.8%\nBut IT hiring silently resumed.\nTCS alone: 40,000 freshers planned.\n\nHere's the CONTRARIAN PLAY:\n\nWhile everyone sells IT on \"AI will kill jobs\"...\nReality: AI needs MORE engineers, not less.\n\nThe data nobody sees:\nâ€¢ Dollar at 83.25 (worst rupee performance in Asia)\nâ€¢ IT gets 60% revenue in dollars\nâ€¢ Effective revenue boost: 8-10% FREE\n\nBanking falling (-0.5%) â†’ Money rotating to IT\nClassic sector rotation most miss.\n\nMy position:\nLong IT, Short Banks.\nTime horizon: 6 months.\nTarget: 15-20% outperformance.\n\nThe crowd is ALWAYS wrong at inflection points.\n2008: \"IT is finished\" â†’ 300% returns by 2010\n2025: \"AI kills IT\" â†’ Watch what happens next.\n\nWhat's your contrarian bet?\n\n#TradingStrategy #MarketAnalysis #ContrarianInvesting #TechnicalAnalysis",

      "content": "I lost â‚¹15 lakhs in 2008.\n\nMy wife didn't talk to me for 3 months.\nMy parents said \"We told you so.\"\nMy friends? They disappeared.\n\nSensex crashed from 21,000 to 8,000.\n\nI sold EVERYTHING.\n\nBiggest mistake of my life?\nNo.\nBest education I ever got.\n\nHere's what that â‚¹15 lakh loss taught me:\n\nLESSON 1: The market ALWAYS recovers\nSensex today: 83,014\nMy â‚¹15 lakhs would be worth â‚¹1.3 crores.\nBut I sold at the bottom.\n\nLESSON 2: Your emotions are expensive\nFear cost me â‚¹1.15 crores (1.3cr - 15L).\nMost expensive emotion I ever felt.\n\nLESSON 3: Rich people buy during crashes\nWhile I sold, they bought.\nSame stocks. 75% discount.\nToday they're billionaires.\n\nLESSON 4: India's story is UNSTOPPABLE\n2008: Nobody believed in India\n2025: We're the 4th largest economy\nWe literally overtook JAPAN.\n\nWhat I do differently now:\n\nCrash = Shopping time.\nGreen days = Do nothing.\nRed days = Buy quality.\n\nMy current portfolio:\nDown 10%? I add more.\nUp 50%? I hold.\nSideways? I wait.\n\nThat â‚¹15 lakh loss?\nMade me â‚¹3.7 crores in the next decade.\n\nBecause I learned:\nWealth isn't made in bull markets.\nIt's made in BEAR markets.\nYou just collect it in bull markets.\n\nYour losses aren't failures.\nThey're tuition fees.\nThe question is - are you learning?\n\nP.S. Still have that 2008 portfolio screenshot.\nMy desktop wallpaper.\nMy daily reminder: Patience pays in CRORES.\n\n#WealthCreation #InvestmentMindset #FinancialFreedom #StockMarket",
