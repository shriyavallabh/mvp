  "content": "I told my HNI client NOT to buy gold at $1,800 in 2020.\n\n\"Too expensive,\" I said. \"Wait for correction.\"\n\nToday: Gold touches $4,000.\nThat advice? Cost him \u20b947 lakhs in opportunity loss.\n\nHere's what 5 years managing \u20b9500+ crore portfolios taught me that nobody talks about:\n\nThe \"wait for correction\" mindset is wealth destruction in disguise.\n\nIn our HNI portfolios:\n\u2192 Clients who held 10% gold allocation: +127% returns since 2020\n\u2192 Clients who waited for \"correction\": Still waiting, still losing to inflation\n\u2192 Diversification isn't sexy. But it's the difference between \u20b95 cr and \u20b911.35 cr today.\n\nGold at $3,955.90 isn't \"expensive.\"\nIt's insurance your portfolio desperately needs.\n\nThe data is brutal:\n\u2022 FII exodus: $15.46 BILLION this year\n\u2022 Market cap loss: $1.3 TRILLION\n\u2022 Gold allocation in our top portfolios: UP from 8% to 15%\n\nYour grandmother's gold wasn't superstition.\nIt was superior portfolio construction.\n\nWhen IT stocks surge 2.3% and everyone's chasing momentum, the smartest money is doing the opposite\u2014rebalancing into stability.\n\nPortfolio review question I ask every HNI client:\n\"What percentage of your wealth survives if equity markets correct 40%?\"\n\nIf you don't have an answer, we need to talk.\n\nP.S. That client from 2020? We rebalanced his portfolio last week. 15% gold allocation now. Some lessons cost \u20b947 lakhs. This one won't.\n\nBuilding Wealth, Creating Trust\nShruti Petkar | ARN-125847\n\n#WealthManagement #PortfolioStrategy #GoldInvestment #HNIInvesting\n\nMutual fund investments are subject to market risks.
