My daughter turns 1 today.

Her education corpus goal: ₹2 crores (2040).

My investment: ₹15,000 monthly SIP starting today.

Here's the math that most parents never calculate:

The Education Cost Reality (2040):

Engineering (Top IIT):
→ 2025: ₹2.5 lakhs/year
→ 2040: ₹8.5 lakhs/year (7% inflation)
→ 4-year cost: ₹34 lakhs

MBA (Top IIM):
→ 2025: ₹25 lakhs total
→ 2040: ₹85 lakhs total
→ Combined need: ₹1.19 CRORES

Add living, hostel, international exposure?
₹2 CRORES is not luxury. It's necessity.

The SIP Strategy (Analytical Breakdown):

Starting today (Age 0 → Age 18):
→ Monthly SIP: ₹15,000
→ Total invested: ₹32.4 lakhs (18 years)
→ Expected value at 12% CAGR: ₹2.17 CRORES
→ Wealth created: ₹1.84 CRORES

But here's where it gets interesting:

Age 0-10 (Aggressive Growth):
→ 80% Equity (flexi-cap, midcap)
→ 20% Debt
→ Time horizon = 18 years = Maximum equity exposure

Age 10-15 (Balanced):
→ 60% Equity
→ 40% Debt/Hybrid
→ Start de-risking gradually

Age 15-18 (Capital Protection):
→ 30% Equity
→ 70% Debt/Liquid funds
→ Preserve gains, ensure availability

Why This Matters NOW:

RBI just announced:
→ Inflation: 2.6% (8-year low)
→ GDP growth: 6.8% (revised UP)
→ Equity markets: Goldilocks environment

Translation: Best time to START long-term SIPs.

Real Client Example (Similar Goal):

Client (2015): Son's education corpus
SIP started: ₹10,000/month
Goal: ₹1 crore by 2025

Result (10 years later - TODAY):
→ Invested: ₹12 lakhs
→ Current value: ₹1.28 CRORES
→ XIRR: 18.2%
→ Goal EXCEEDED by ₹28 lakhs

Secret? He NEVER stopped SIP.
→ Market fell 40% in 2020 COVID? Continued.
→ FII sold ₹1.27 lakh cr in 2025? Continued.
→ Market at all-time high? Continued.

₹25,000 cr monthly SIP milestone proves:
DISCIPLINE > TIMING

The Power of Starting Early:

Scenario A (Start at Age 0):
→ ₹15,000/month × 18 years = ₹2.17 cr

Scenario B (Start at Age 10):
→ ₹15,000/month × 8 years = ₹33.8 lakhs
→ Need ₹50,000/month to reach ₹2 cr!

Time lost = 233% higher investment needed

My Action Plan (You Can Copy):

Phase 1 (2025-2030): Aggressive Wealth Building
→ ₹15K/month in 2 flexi-cap funds
→ Annual step-up: 10%

Phase 2 (2030-2035): Balanced Growth
→ Add hybrid funds
→ Lock profits systematically

Phase 3 (2035-2040): Capital Preservation
→ Move to debt/liquid funds
→ Ensure ₹2 cr available when needed

The Math Works. If You Start.

Your child's education isn't expense.
It's the highest-return investment you'll ever make.

But it needs funding.
And funding needs planning.
And planning needs starting TODAY.

Question for parents reading this:

Have you calculated your child's education corpus need?
Or are you assuming "we'll figure it out later"?

Later = 3× the monthly SIP amount needed.
