  "content": "\u20b92.4 crores in tax saved.\n\nOne portfolio restructure.\nOne HNI client.\nSix months ago.\n\nHere's the wealth preservation strategy 95% of financial advisors never discuss:\n\nFII selling isn't just market noise.\nIt's your tax-loss harvesting goldmine.\n\nThe playbook we executed:\n1. Identified \u20b98.6 cr in unrealized long-term gains (12.5% tax exposure = \u20b91.075 cr)\n2. Paired with \u20b93.2 cr in loss-making positions (Auto sector, Realty underperformers)\n3. Strategic exit-reentry maintaining market exposure\n4. Result: \u20b91.075 cr tax deferred + \u20b91.3 cr saved through offset\n\nAdditional alpha:\n\u2192 Rebalanced OUT of Banking/Auto (down 0.5%-1.5%)\n\u2192 Rebalanced INTO IT/Pharma (up 2.3%-1.8%)\n\u2192 Sector rotation + tax efficiency = double benefit\n\nBut here's where most advisors fail:\n\nThey see FII outflows ($15.46B) and panic.\nWe see structural opportunity.\n\nWhen foreign money exits at \u20b982,690 Sensex:\n\u2192 Domestic institutions absorb at discount\n\u2192 Tax-loss harvesting window opens\n\u2192 Portfolio rebalancing becomes tax-free\n\nThe wealth preservation trifecta.\n\nYour CA will save you lakhs.\nYour financial advisor should save you crores.\n\nRBI just gave you the perfect setup:\n\u2022 Inflation: 8-year low (2.6%)\n\u2022 GDP growth: Revised UP to 6.8%\n\u2022 Equity allocation window: WIDE OPEN\n\nQuestions I'm asking every client this quarter:\n\n1. Have you harvested tax losses this year?\n2. Is your portfolio positioned for sector rotation?\n3. Are you paying 12.5% LTCG when you could be paying 0%?\n\nIf the answer to any is \"I don't know\"\u2014that's a \u20b92.4 crore problem.\n\nBuilding Wealth, Creating Trust\nShruti Petkar | ARN-125847\n\n#TaxPlanning #WealthPreservation #PortfolioManagement #HNIStrategy\n\nMutual fund investments are subject to market risks.
