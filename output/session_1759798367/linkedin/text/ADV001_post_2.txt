₹2.4 crores in tax saved.

One portfolio restructure.
One HNI client.
Six months ago.

Here's the wealth preservation strategy 95% of financial advisors never discuss:

FII selling isn't just market noise.
It's your tax-loss harvesting goldmine.

The playbook we executed:
1. Identified ₹8.6 cr in unrealized long-term gains (12.5% tax exposure = ₹1.075 cr)
2. Paired with ₹3.2 cr in loss-making positions (Auto sector, Realty underperformers)
3. Strategic exit-reentry maintaining market exposure
4. Result: ₹1.075 cr tax deferred + ₹1.3 cr saved through offset

Additional alpha:
→ Rebalanced OUT of Banking/Auto (down 0.5%-1.5%)
→ Rebalanced INTO IT/Pharma (up 2.3%-1.8%)
→ Sector rotation + tax efficiency = double benefit

But here's where most advisors fail:

They see FII outflows ($15.46B) and panic.
We see structural opportunity.

When foreign money exits at ₹82,690 Sensex:
→ Domestic institutions absorb at discount
→ Tax-loss harvesting window opens
→ Portfolio rebalancing becomes tax-free

The wealth preservation trifecta.

Your CA will save you lakhs.
Your financial advisor should save you crores.

RBI just gave you the perfect setup:
• Inflation: 8-year low (2.6%)
• GDP growth: Revised UP to 6.8%
• Equity allocation window: WIDE OPEN

Questions I'm asking every client this quarter:

1. Have you harvested tax losses this year?
2. Is your portfolio positioned for sector rotation?
3. Are you paying 12.5% LTCG when you could be paying 0%?

If the answer to any is "I don't know"—that's a ₹2.4 crore problem.
