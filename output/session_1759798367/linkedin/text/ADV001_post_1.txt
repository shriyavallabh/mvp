I told my HNI client NOT to buy gold at $1,800 in 2020.

"Too expensive," I said. "Wait for correction."

Today: Gold touches $4,000.
That advice? Cost him ₹47 lakhs in opportunity loss.

Here's what 5 years managing ₹500+ crore portfolios taught me that nobody talks about:

The "wait for correction" mindset is wealth destruction in disguise.

In our HNI portfolios:
→ Clients who held 10% gold allocation: +127% returns since 2020
→ Clients who waited for "correction": Still waiting, still losing to inflation
→ Diversification isn't sexy. But it's the difference between ₹5 cr and ₹11.35 cr today.

Gold at $3,955.90 isn't "expensive."
It's insurance your portfolio desperately needs.

The data is brutal:
• FII exodus: $15.46 BILLION this year
• Market cap loss: $1.3 TRILLION
• Gold allocation in our top portfolios: UP from 8% to 15%

Your grandmother's gold wasn't superstition.
It was superior portfolio construction.

When IT stocks surge 2.3% and everyone's chasing momentum, the smartest money is doing the opposite—rebalancing into stability.

Portfolio review question I ask every HNI client:
"What percentage of your wealth survives if equity markets correct 40%?"

If you don't have an answer, we need to talk.

P.S. That client from 2020? We rebalanced his portfolio last week. 15% gold allocation now. Some lessons cost ₹47 lakhs. This one won't.
