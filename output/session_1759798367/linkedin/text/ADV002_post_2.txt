Why are IT stocks up 2.3% while Auto is down 0.5%?

Same market. Same day. Opposite directions.

This is sector rotation. And it's about to make (or cost) you lakhs.

Let me decode what's happening RIGHT NOW:

The Sector Performance Data (October 7, 2025):

WINNERS:
→ IT: +2.3% (TCS +3.2%, Infosys +2.8%)
→ Pharma: +1.8% (Sun Pharma +2.5%)
→ Banking: +0.54% (stable, recovering)

LOSERS:
→ Auto: -0.5% (M&M -1.5%, Tata Motors -1.2%)
→ Realty: -1.2% (interest rate concerns)
→ FMCG: -0.3% (demand uncertainty)

But WHY is this happening?

The 3 Forces Driving Sector Rotation:

1. Currency Effect
→ USD/INR at 83.25 (rupee weaker)
→ IT companies earn in dollars, report in rupees
→ Every $1 billion revenue = ₹75 cr MORE profit
→ TCS, Infosys = Direct beneficiaries

2. Defensive Flight
→ FII selling = ₹1.27 lakh cr outflow
→ Investors moving from cyclicals (Auto) to defensives (Pharma, IT)
→ Risk-off sentiment = Quality over momentum

3. Global Tailwinds
→ US markets: Nasdaq fresh record high (+0.7%)
→ Tech rally globally
→ Indian IT sector piggybacks on global tech strength

What This Means for YOUR Portfolio:

If you're 100% in Auto/Banking:
→ Missed IT's 2.3% gain today
→ Missing Pharma's defensive strength
→ Concentration risk = portfolio underperformance

Diversification Math:

Portfolio A (Concentrated):
→ 100% Banking/Auto
→ Today's return: -0.2%

Portfolio B (Diversified):
→ 30% IT, 30% Banking, 20% Pharma, 20% Auto
→ Today's return: +0.84%

Difference: 1.04% in ONE day
Annualized impact: 380% difference

Over ₹10 lakh portfolio? That's ₹38,000 annual difference.

The Rebalancing Question:

Should you CHASE IT sector now?

Data-Driven Answer:

1. If underweight (<20% IT): YES, add systematically via SIP
2. If balanced (20-30% IT): HOLD, let it run
3. If overweight (>40% IT): Consider booking partial profits

My Recommendation for Balanced Growth:

→ 35% Largecap (Nifty 50 diversified)
→ 25% IT/Pharma (sector rotation beneficiaries)
→ 20% Banking (value buy after correction)
→ 10% Midcap (growth potential)
→ 10% Gold (₹80K - portfolio stabilizer)

Why This Works:

Sensex at 81,790 (+0.72% today)
Nifty at 25,077 (+0.74%)
Bank Nifty at 55,889 (+0.54%)

Markets are rotating, NOT crashing.
Your portfolio should rotate WITH them.

Action Steps This Week:

1. Check your sector allocation (most portfolio apps show this)
2. Identify concentration risk (>40% in one sector = red flag)
3. Plan systematic rebalancing (don't panic sell/buy - use SIP route)

Sector rotation isn't something to fear.
It's opportunity to optimize.
