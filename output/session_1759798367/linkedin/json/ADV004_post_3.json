No emergency fund. ₹8,000 in bank.\n\nThat day taught me the most expensive lesson of my life.\n\nIf you're reading this and don't have 6 months emergency fund—STOP investing and build this first.\n\nHere's my story:\n\nOctober 2019:\n\nJob: Product Manager at startup\nSalary: ₹12 LPA (₹1L/month)\nInvestments: ₹15,000 monthly SIP (feeling smart!)\nEmergency fund: ZERO (feeling stupid later)\n\nOctober 15, 2019:\n→ Startup ran out of funding\n→ Entire team laid off\n→ Last salary: Paid\n→ Next salary: ?\n\nMy financial reality:\n→ Bank balance: ₹8,000\n→ Credit card due: ₹45,000 (just booked Goa trip)\n→ Rent due: ₹18,000\n→ EMI (bike): ₹6,500\n→ Investment portfolio: ₹4.2 lakhs (locked in mutual funds)\n\nTotal NEEDED immediately: ₹77,500\nTotal AVAILABLE: ₹8,000\n\nI was broke with ₹4.2 lakhs in investments.\n\nThe Brutal Next 30 Days:\n\nWeek 1: Panic\n→ Applied to 50 jobs\n→ Borrowed ₹50K from friend for rent + CC bill\n→ Sold bike to pay EMI (₹30K loss on resale)\n\nWeek 2: Desperation\n→ Started redeeming mutual funds\n→ Exit load: 1%\n→ Sold at 15% loss (market was down)\n→ ₹4.2L became ₹3.2L after loss + exit load\n\nWeek 3: Regret\n→ Living on ₹100/day food budget\n→ Stopped all SIPs\n→ Cancelled subscriptions (Netflix, gym, everything)\n\nWeek 4: Learning\n→ Got job offer (lower salary: ₹9 LPA)\n→ Took it desperately\n→ Vowed: NEVER again without emergency fund\n\nThe Cost of No Emergency Fund:\n\nFinancial loss:\n→ MF redemption loss: ₹1 lakh\n→ Bike distress sale loss: ₹30K\n→ Friend loan interest: ₹5K\n→ Total: ₹1.35 LAKHS\n\nEmotional cost:\n→ Stress: Unmeasurable\n→ Anxiety: 30 sleepless nights\n→ Borrowing from friends: Embarrassment\n→ Restarting career at lower salary: Setback\n\nThe Emergency Fund I Built After (And YOU Should Too):\n\nTarget: 6 months expenses\n\nMy monthly expenses:\n→ Rent: ₹18,000\n→ Food: ₹8,000\n→ Transport: ₹3,000\n→ Utilities: ₹2,000\n→ Misc: ₹5,000\n→ Total: ₹36,000/month\n\nEmergency fund needed: ₹36,000 × 6 = ₹2,16,000\n\nHow I built it (2020-2021):\n\nPhase 1 (Month 1-3): Foundation\n→ Saved ₹15,000/month aggressively\n→ No investments yet (lesson learned!)\n→ Built: ₹45,000\n\nPhase 2 (Month 4-9): Acceleration\n→ Salary hike to ₹10 LPA\n→ Saved ₹20,000/month\n→ Built: ₹1,65,000 (total)\n\nPhase 3 (Month 10-12): Completion\n→ Bonus + tax refund: ₹55,000\n→ Emergency fund: ₹2,20,000 ✅\n\nWhere I Kept It:\n\nNOT in:\n→ Savings account (too tempted to spend)\n→ FD (lock-in period, penalty on early withdrawal)\n→ Equity (too volatile for emergency needs)\n\nYES in:\n→ Liquid mutual fund (withdraw in 24 hours, no penalty)\n→ Returns: 5-6% (better than savings account)\n→ Liquidity: T+1 day (fast access)\n\nThe Right Investment Priority Order:\n\nThis is the sequence EVERYONE should follow:\n\n1. EMERGENCY FUND (6 months expenses)\n→ Build FIRST before any investing\n→ Liquid fund/savings account\n→ Non-negotiable safety net\n\n2. INSURANCE\n→ Health insurance (₹5-10L cover minimum)\n→ Term life insurance (if you have dependents)\n\n3. RETIREMENT/WEALTH BUILDING\n→ NOW start equity SIP\n→ Long-term wealth creation\n\n4. GOALS (Home, car, vacation)\n→ After foundation is set\n→ Goal-based investing\n\nI Had It BACKWARDS in 2019:\n→ Jumped straight to Step 3 (SIP)\n→ Skipped Step 1 (Emergency fund)\n→ Result: Disaster\n\nToday (2025):\n→ Emergency fund: ₹3 lakhs (secure)\n→ Monthly SIP: ₹18,000 (growing)\n→ Portfolio: ₹12.8 lakhs (stress-free!)\n\nThe Difference?\n\n2019: ₹4.2L invested, ZERO security → Lost ₹1.35L in crisis\n2025: ₹12.8L invested, ₹3L emergency fund → Sleep peacefully\n\nReal Talk for Beginners:\n\nIf you're 25-30 and thinking \"SIP first, emergency fund later\"—STOP.\n\nI see this mistake everywhere:\n→ Instagram shows SIP screenshots (glamorous)\n→ Nobody shows emergency fund (boring)\n→ Result: You copy the WRONG priority\n\nThe Unsexy Truth:\n→ Emergency fund is boring\n→ Emergency fund gives 5-6% returns (vs 12% SIP)\n→ Emergency fund just \"sits there\"\n\nBut emergency fund = FREEDOM to let SIP compound undisturbed.\n\nWithout emergency fund:\n→ Job loss → Redeem investments (loss)\n→ Medical emergency → Break SIP (compounding destroyed)\n→ Urgent expense → Credit card debt (18% interest trap)\n\nWith emergency fund:\n→ Crisis hits → Use emergency fund\n→ Investments → Keep compounding\n→ SIP → Continues uninterrupted\n\nYour Action Plan Starting TODAY:\n\nStep 1: Calculate 6-month expenses\n(Rent + Food + Bills + EMI = Monthly expense × 6)\n\nStep 2: Open liquid mutual fund account\n(Groww, Zerodha, Paytm Money - any app works)\n\nStep 3: Start emergency fund SIP\n(₹5,000-₹10,000/month till target reached)\n\nStep 4: AFTER emergency fund complete → Start wealth SIP\n\nDon't make my 2019 mistake.\n\nBuild the foundation BEFORE the building.\n\nDrop a ✅ if you have 6-month emergency fund.\nDrop a ⚠️ if you're building it now.\n\nLet's build financial security together.\n\nSmart Investments, Secure Future\nAvalok Langer | ARN-169741\n\nMutual fund investments are subject to market risks.
