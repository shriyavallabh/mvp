  "content": "₹2.4 crores in tax saved.\n\nOne portfolio restructure.\nOne HNI client.\nSix months ago.\n\nHere's the wealth preservation strategy 95% of financial advisors never discuss:\n\nFII selling isn't just market noise.\nIt's your tax-loss harvesting goldmine.\n\nThe playbook we executed:\n1. Identified ₹8.6 cr in unrealized long-term gains (12.5% tax exposure = ₹1.075 cr)\n2. Paired with ₹3.2 cr in loss-making positions (Auto sector, Realty underperformers)\n3. Strategic exit-reentry maintaining market exposure\n4. Result: ₹1.075 cr tax deferred + ₹1.3 cr saved through offset\n\nAdditional alpha:\n→ Rebalanced OUT of Banking/Auto (down 0.5%-1.5%)\n→ Rebalanced INTO IT/Pharma (up 2.3%-1.8%)\n→ Sector rotation + tax efficiency = double benefit\n\nBut here's where most advisors fail:\n\nThey see FII outflows ($15.46B) and panic.\nWe see structural opportunity.\n\nWhen foreign money exits at ₹82,690 Sensex:\n→ Domestic institutions absorb at discount\n→ Tax-loss harvesting window opens\n→ Portfolio rebalancing becomes tax-free\n\nThe wealth preservation trifecta.\n\nYour CA will save you lakhs.\nYour financial advisor should save you crores.\n\nRBI just gave you the perfect setup:\n• Inflation: 8-year low (2.6%)\n• GDP growth: Revised UP to 6.8%\n• Equity allocation window: WIDE OPEN\n\nQuestions I'm asking every client this quarter:\n\n1. Have you harvested tax losses this year?\n2. Is your portfolio positioned for sector rotation?\n3. Are you paying 12.5% LTCG when you could be paying 0%?\n\nIf the answer to any is \"I don't know\"—that's a ₹2.4 crore problem.\n\nBuilding Wealth, Creating Trust\nShruti Petkar | ARN-125847\n\nMutual fund investments are subject to market risks.
