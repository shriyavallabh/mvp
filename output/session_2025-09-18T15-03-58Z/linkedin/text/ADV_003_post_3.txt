Everyone's talking about Fed rate cuts, but here's what actually matters for Indian investors:

🌍 GLOBAL IMPACT:
• US cuts rates = Dollar weakens
• Foreign money flows to India
• IT companies benefit (earn in dollars!)

🇮🇳 INDIA IMPACT:
✅ Good for stocks (money seeks returns)
✅ Good for gold (dollar weakness)
❌ Bad for NRIs (rupee may strengthen)

📊 YOUR ACTION PLAN:

If you have ₹1 Lakh to invest:
• 40% in IT funds (₹40,000)
• 30% in banking funds (₹30,000)
• 20% in gold ETFs (₹20,000)
• 10% keep liquid (₹10,000)

If you're a SIP investor:
• Continue as normal
• Add IT sector fund if possible
• Don't stop existing SIPs!

If you have loans:
