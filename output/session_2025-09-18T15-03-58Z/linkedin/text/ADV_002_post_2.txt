💡 How I helped Rahul save ₹40,000 in taxes (you can too!)

Meet Rahul, 32, IT Professional, earning ₹12 LPA.
His problem? Paying ₹1.5 Lakhs in taxes! 😓

Here's the simple plan we created:

📝 STEP 1: Basic Tax Savers (₹1.5 Lakhs)
• ELSS SIP: ₹8,000/month = ₹96,000
• PPF: ₹2,000/month = ₹24,000
• Term Insurance: ₹15,000/year
• Home Loan Principal: ₹15,000

✅ Tax Saved: ₹46,800!

📝 STEP 2: Health Protection (₹50,000)
• Family Health Insurance: ₹25,000
• Parents Coverage: ₹25,000

✅ Additional Saving: ₹15,500!

📝 STEP 3: Smart Moves
• NPS: ₹50,000 extra (Sec 80CCD)
• Saving: ₹15,500

🎯 TOTAL TAX SAVED: ₹77,800!

But here's the best part:
His ELSS grew 15% last year = ₹14,400 profit
PPF gives guaranteed 7.1%
Insurance protects family

So he's not just saving tax, he's building wealth!
