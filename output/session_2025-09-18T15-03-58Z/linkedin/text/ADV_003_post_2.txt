ðŸŽ“ SIP Explained in 30 Seconds (Save this!)

Confused about SIP? Let me explain with chai! â˜•

Imagine you buy chai everyday:
Monday: â‚¹10
Tuesday: â‚¹12
Wednesday: â‚¹8
Thursday: â‚¹11
Friday: â‚¹9

Average price? â‚¹10!
You saved money on expensive days! ðŸ’°

THAT'S EXACTLY HOW SIP WORKS!

ðŸ“ˆ When market is UP = You buy less units
ðŸ“‰ When market is DOWN = You buy more units
= Average cost becomes lower!

REAL EXAMPLE:
â‚¹5,000 SIP for 5 years
Total invested: â‚¹3,00,000
Value after 5 years: â‚¹4,25,000*
Profit: â‚¹1,25,000! ðŸŽ‰

START YOUR SIP WITH:
âœ… â‚¹500 - Coffee money
âœ… â‚¹1,000 - Movie ticket
âœ… â‚¹5,000 - Weekend party

3 SIMPLE RULES:
1. Start NOW (time > timing)
2. Never stop (even in bad markets)
3. Increase yearly (raise = raise SIP)
