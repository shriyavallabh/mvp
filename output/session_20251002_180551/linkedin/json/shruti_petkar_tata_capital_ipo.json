    "body": "₹15,512 crore.\n\nThat's not just a number. That's Tata Capital's IPO size.\n\nThe LARGEST IPO of 2025.\n\nAnd here's the part that separates retail from institutional thinking:\n\nAnchor portion opens October 3.\nSize: ₹4,600 crore.\nExpected oversubscription: 4x.\n\nTranslation? ₹18,400 crore chasing ₹4,600 crore allocation.\n\nYou don't get what you apply for. You get what strategy delivers.\n\nI've seen this movie before:\n\n→ LIC IPO: Retail euphoria, post-listing disappointment\n→ Paytm IPO: FOMO applications, value destruction\n→ Zomato IPO: Hype vs fundamentals disconnect\n\nThen the winners:\n\n→ HDFC Bank (1995): Applied for ₹10,000, became ₹18 lakhs\n→ Infosys (1993): ₹95 became ₹75,000\n→ Avenue Supermarts (2017): Listing gains + 5-year 400% returns\n\nThe difference? Quality over quantity. Allocation strategy over application frenzy.\n\nHere's the HNI playbook for Tata Capital:\n\n**Due Diligence (Not FOMO):**\n\n1. Tata brand premium: Real or perceived?\n2. Financial services growth trajectory: Sustainable?\n3. Valuation metrics: Expensive or justified?\n4. Competitive positioning: Defensible moat?\n5. Post-RBI dovish stance: Beneficiary or bystander?\n\n**Allocation Strategy (Not Lottery Mindset):**\n\nHNI quota offers better odds than retail.\nBut better odds ≠ guaranteed returns.\n\nQuestions to ask:\n\n→ What % of portfolio should IPO allocation represent?\n→ Is this a listing gains play or long-term hold?\n→ How does this fit sectoral diversification?\n→ What's the exit strategy if overvalued at listing?\n\n**The Tata Factor:**\n\nTata Motors demerger just created wealth (Oct 1).\nTata Technologies IPO delivered 140% listing gains.\nTata Consultancy: Wealth compounder for 2 decades.\n\nBrand has track record. But track record isn't guarantee.\n\n**My Take:**\n\nThis isn't your \"apply and forget\" IPO.\n\nThis is:\n✓ Strategic allocation sizing\n✓ Valuation-conscious participation\n✓ Post-listing monitoring discipline\n✓ Portfolio fit assessment\n\nWith RBI turning dovish and rate cuts expected by December, financial services could be a tailwind sector.\n\nBut IPO pricing will determine if that tailwind becomes your wealth wind or just market noise.\n\nHNI investors don't chase. They evaluate. They strategize. They execute with discipline.\n\nTata Capital IPO is an opportunity. Whether it becomes YOUR opportunity depends on:\n\n→ Your portfolio allocation limits\n→ Your valuation discipline\n→ Your long-term strategy alignment\n→ Your ability to ignore FOMO and apply logic\n\nAnchor opens October 3. You have 48 hours to think like an investor, not a lottery player.\n\nP.S. Remember: The best IPO returns come from companies you'd want to hold even if the stock market closed for 10 years. Does Tata Capital pass that test for you?\n\nShruti Petkar | Building Wealth, Creating Trust\nARN: ARN-125847",
