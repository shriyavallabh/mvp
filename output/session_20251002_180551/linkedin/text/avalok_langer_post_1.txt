October 2, 2025.

Markets are closed.
Gandhi Jayanti holiday.

But your portfolio? Still working.

Let me explain why this is the most important investing lesson.

Yesterday (October 1):
Sensex jumped 715 points.
Nifty gained 220 points.
Your SIP investments? They grew.

Today (October 2):
Markets closed.
Traders taking a break.
Your SIP investments? Still compounding.

Tomorrow (October 3):
Markets reopen.
Rally likely to continue.
Your SIP investments? Ready to capture gains.

This is the beauty of systematic investing.

Most people think:
"I need to watch markets daily"
"I must time my entry perfectly"
"Holidays mean my money isn't working"

Reality:
‚Üí Markets work even when you don't watch
‚Üí SIP removes timing pressure
‚Üí Your investments compound 24/7, holidays or not

Let me share a simple truth:

My most successful clients?
They DON'T check portfolio daily.

They:
‚úÖ Set up SIP
‚úÖ Forget about it
‚úÖ Check once a quarter
‚úÖ Watch wealth grow

My most stressed clients?
They check Sensex every hour.

They:
‚ùå Panic on red days
‚ùå Get greedy on green days
‚ùå Keep pausing/restarting SIP
‚ùå Never build wealth

The Gandhi Jayanti lesson:

Markets took a break today.
But systematic investors didn't worry.

Why?

Because yesterday's 715-point gain is already in their portfolio.
Tomorrow's rally? They're positioned to capture it.
No daily tracking needed.

Real example from my clients:

Client A (Active Trader):
- Watches markets 5 hours daily
- Tries to time every entry/exit
- Stressed on holidays (can't trade)
- 3-year return: 9% annually

Client B (SIP Investor):
- Checks portfolio once a month
- Rs 10,000 SIP running on autopilot
- Enjoyed Gandhi Jayanti holiday peacefully
- 3-year return: 14% annually

Same market. Different approach. Different results.

What changed?

Client A's returns were eaten by:
- Bad timing decisions
- Panic selling in corrections
- Missing rallies while "waiting for dip"

Client B's returns compounded because:
- Monthly SIP bought at all levels
- Corrections = more units at lower price
- Rallies = portfolio value growth
- Zero stress, maximum compounding

The SIP superpower:

When markets fall 10%:
‚Üí Traders panic and sell
‚Üí SIP investors buy more units

When markets rise 10%:
‚Üí Traders fear "too high" and wait
‚Üí SIP investors already participated

This is called:
Rupee Cost Averaging

Fancy term. Simple meaning.

You invest Rs 10,000 monthly:

Month 1: Nifty at 24,000 ‚Üí Buy 100 units
Month 2: Nifty at 22,000 ‚Üí Buy 110 units (market down)
Month 3: Nifty at 26,000 ‚Üí Buy 92 units (market up)

Total invested: Rs 30,000
Total units: 302 units
Average cost: Rs 99.3 per unit

If you tried timing (waited for "perfect entry"):
Likely entered at 26,000 (bought 115 units)
SIP got you 302 units vs 115 units

162% more units. Same money.

This is why SIP wins.

Current opportunity:

Markets at 80,983 (Sensex)
RBI turned positive (rate cuts coming)
IT sector recovering (+1.72%)
Banking showing strength

Should you wait for correction?

NO.

Start SIP now. Let it work through all market phases.

If market goes up: You participate
If market corrects: You get more units
Either way: You win over 3-5 years

The beginner's SIP blueprint:

Step 1: Start with what you can afford
Rs 1,000 monthly? Perfect.
Rs 5,000 monthly? Even better.
Rs 10,000 monthly? Excellent.

Amount doesn't matter. Consistency does.

Step 2: Choose simple funds
- Nifty 50 Index Fund (for large cap safety)
- Flexi Cap Fund (for diversification)
- Don't overthink fund selection

Step 3: Automate completely
Set up auto-debit.
Forget manual investing.
Let system run.

Step 4: Ignore daily noise
Markets will be red some days.
Markets will be green some days.
Your SIP doesn't care. It keeps buying.

Step 5: Review quarterly
Not daily. Not weekly. Quarterly.
Check if SIP is running.
That's it.

Why Gandhi Jayanti is a perfect example:

Yesterday: Market rallied 715 points (you benefited)
Today: Market closed (you're relaxed, not stressed)
Tomorrow: Market reopens (you're positioned)

SIP investors sleep peacefully.
Because their system works whether markets are open or closed.

Your action plan:

‚úÖ Start SIP if you haven't (even Rs 1,000 works)
‚úÖ Continue SIP if you have (don't pause for "perfect timing")
‚úÖ Increase SIP if possible (increments build wealth faster)
‚úÖ Stop daily checking (quarterly review is enough)

Markets don't need your daily attention.
They need your patient participation.

Gandhi Jayanti taught this lesson perfectly.

Markets closed.
Traders frustrated.
SIP investors? Chilling.

Because wealth compounds in the background.
Not in front of your screen.

Tomorrow markets reopen.
Your SIP is ready.

Are you?
