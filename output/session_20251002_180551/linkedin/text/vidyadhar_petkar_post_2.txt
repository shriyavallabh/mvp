August 2024: IT stocks crashed.

H1B visa fee hike announced.
TCS lost Rs 97,598 crore market cap overnight.
Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra - all bleeding.

Panic sellers booked losses.
"IT sector is doomed," they said.

Fast forward to October 2, 2025:

TCS: +1.82%
Infosys: +1.68%
Nifty IT: +1.72%

Rs 97,598 crore loss? Fully recovered.

What changed?

Nothing and everything.

The H1B visa fee hike didn't go away.
But markets understood what panic sellers missed:

IT sector resilience isn't about visa policies.
It's about:
→ Dollar revenue streams
→ Digital transformation demand
→ Operational efficiency
→ Client diversification

Let me break down what really happened:

Phase 1: Panic (August 2024)
H1B visa fees increased by $4,000-$5,000 per application.
Media headlines: "IT sector margins will collapse"
Knee-jerk reaction: Sell first, think later
TCS crashed from Rs 4,100 to Rs 3,650 (-11%)

Phase 2: Analysis (September 2024)
Smart analysts ran the numbers:
- H1B cost increase = 0.3-0.5% margin impact
- Total margin: 24-26%
- Actual impact: Negligible in the bigger picture

But damage was done. Panic sellers had exited.

Phase 3: Recovery (October 2025)
Rupee weakness emerged (Rs 83.42/dollar)
Every dollar earned = more rupees
Dollar revenue became competitive advantage
IT stocks started climbing back

Today: Full recovery + momentum

The lesson most investors missed:

Markets panic on headlines.
Fundamentals eventually win.

Those who sold TCS at Rs 3,650 in panic:
→ Booked 11% loss
→ Missed 7.4% recovery
→ Total opportunity cost: 18.4%

Those who bought TCS at Rs 3,650:
→ Accumulated at discount
→ Made 7.4% in weeks
→ Plus dividend yield 1.8%
→ Total gain: 9.2%

Same stock. Different outcomes.

The pattern repeats:

2020: COVID panic → IT stocks crashed → Recovered 120% in 18 months
2022: Fed rate hike fears → IT sold off → Recovered 45% in 12 months
2024: H1B visa fee → IT crashed → Recovered fully in 10 months

Every panic creates accumulation opportunity.
Every recovery rewards patience.

Current opportunity - IT sector in 2025:

✅ Valuations reasonable (P/E: 22-24x vs peak 28-30x)
✅ Rupee weakness = margin tailwind
✅ Digital transformation = long-term demand
✅ Q2 results ahead (October) - likely positive surprises
✅ FII selling created value buying opportunity

Why IT deserves portfolio allocation now:

1. Defensive Growth
Even in slowdown, IT grows 8-10%. In recovery, 15-18%.

2. Dollar Hedge
Rupee at Rs 83.42. Every Re 1 depreciation = margin expansion.

3. Quality Management
TCS, Infosys - track record of navigating cycles.

4. Dividend Yield
TCS: 1.8%, Infosys: 2.1% - income while you wait for appreciation.

My systematic accumulation framework:

Don't go all-in on recovery.
Build position in tranches:

Tranche 1 (October): 30% allocation
Tranche 2 (November): 30% allocation
Tranche 3 (December): 40% allocation

This way:
- You participate in recovery
- You average out volatility
- You don't regret if correction happens

The meta-lesson:

In investing, noise creates opportunity.
Headlines create panic.
Panic creates mispricing.
Mispricing creates wealth.

Your competitive advantage isn't information.
Everyone gets the same news.

Your advantage is temperament.
Can you buy when others panic?
Can you hold when others sell?

IT sector taught this lesson again.
TCS is back to Rs 3,920.
The panic sellers are still nursing losses.
The patient accumulators are compounding.

What will you do next time panic strikes?
