August 2025: "IT stocks will crash! H1B visa fees increased!"

October 2025: TCS recovered ‚Çπ97,598 crore market cap.

Remember when everyone was panicking?

Let me take you back.

**August: The Panic**

US government announced H1B visa fee hike.

Media headlines:
"IT sector doomed!"
"Sell TCS, Infosys before it's too late!"
"Indian IT facing existential crisis!"

TCS fell 8% in 3 days.
Infosys dropped 7.2%.
Wipro crashed 9.5%.

Market cap eroded: ‚Çπ1.2 lakh crore across IT sector.

WhatsApp groups went crazy:
"Should I exit my IT mutual funds?"
"Is this 2008 again?"
"My portfolio is down 12%!"

**What Smart Investors Did:**

Bought.

Not because they ignored the news.

Because they understood FUNDAMENTALS vs NOISE.

**The Fundamental Reality:**

1. **H1B fees are costs, not revenue killers**
   TCS revenue: ‚Çπ2.4 lakh crore annually
   H1B fee impact: ‚Çπ1,200 crore one-time
   Percentage impact: 0.5%

2. **Indian IT has pivot capability**
   ‚Üí Nearshoring to Mexico, Costa Rica
   ‚Üí Local hiring in US increasing
   ‚Üí Automation reducing dependency
   ‚Üí Cloud services growing 25% YoY

3. **Rupee weakness = IT strength**
   Rupee at ‚Çπ83.42 per dollar
   Every dollar earned = more rupee revenue
   80% revenue is dollar-denominated

4. **Sector leadership intact**
   Global digital transformation: $4 trillion market
   Indian IT companies: 15% market share
   Growth trajectory: Unchanged

**October: The Recovery**

Nifty IT Index: Up 1.72% (Oct 1)
TCS: ‚Çπ3,920 (recovered entire loss + more)
Infosys: ‚Çπ1,475 (back to pre-panic levels)

Those who sold in August: Lost money

Those who held: Break-even

Those who BOUGHT in August: Sitting on 8-12% gains in 60 days

**The Lesson Nobody Wants To Admit:**

Markets panic. Smart investors accumulate.

This isn't just about IT stocks. This is about EVERY market correction.

‚Üí March 2020: COVID panic ‚Üí 400% recovery by 2024
‚Üí 2016: Demonetization fear ‚Üí 75% rally by 2018
‚Üí 2013: Taper tantrum ‚Üí 120% gains by 2017
‚Üí August 2025: H1B panic ‚Üí Recovery in 60 days

Pattern recognition is wealth creation.

**How To Identify Real Crisis vs Noise:**

‚úÖ **Noise:** Short-term policy change, media panic, temporary sentiment
‚ùå **Crisis:** Revenue collapse, business model obsolete, competitive moat broken

H1B fee hike = Noise
IT sector fundamentals = Intact

Conclusion: Opportunity, not exit.

**The Current Opportunity:**

IT sector is STILL not back to all-time highs.

There's STILL accumulation opportunity.

Why?

1. Rate cuts coming (December) = Liquidity boost
2. Rupee weakness continues = Revenue tailwind
3. Q2 earnings season approaching = Catalyst ahead
4. FII selling created value = DII buying opportunity

**My IT Sector Framework:**

**Quality Leaders (Accumulate on dips):**
‚Üí TCS: Margin leader, dividend aristocrat
‚Üí Infosys: Digital transformation focus
‚Üí HCL Tech: Product engineering strength

**Avoid:**
‚Üí Overleveraged small IT firms
‚Üí Pure-play H1B dependent companies
‚Üí Low-margin body shopping businesses

**Strategy:**

Don't go all-in. Allocate 15-20% of equity portfolio to quality IT.

Buy on dips (like August panic).

Hold through noise (like visa fee headlines).

Profit from recovery (like October vindication).

**The Bigger Picture:**

IT sector isn't just about coding and visas.

It's about:
‚Üí India's service export dominance (‚Çπ12 lakh crore annually)
‚Üí 50 lakh high-skilled jobs
‚Üí Global digital backbone
‚Üí Consistent USD earnings

One policy change doesn't kill a ‚Çπ10 lakh crore industry.

But panic creates opportunity for those who understand that.

August taught us: Headlines create dips. Fundamentals create wealth.

Which side of the trade were you on?

And more importantly: Which side will you be on NEXT time?
