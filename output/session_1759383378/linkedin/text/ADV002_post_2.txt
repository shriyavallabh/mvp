Indians are investing ₹906 crore DAILY through SIPs - More than entire IPO amounts!

You're part of something historic.

₹27,269 crore monthly SIP inflows.
That's ₹906 crore EVERY SINGLE DAY.

Your ₹5,000 SIP?
It's part of India's biggest wealth revolution.

But here's what changed in just 5 years:

2020: 40% investors exit within 1 year
2025: 30% investors stay 5+ years

From panic sellers to patient wealth builders.

Your parents' generation: Fixed Deposits
Your generation: SIP Portfolios

FD returns (2020-2025): ~35% total
Equity SIP returns (2020-2025): ~85% total

Same 5 years. 2.5X difference.

RBI just upgraded India's GDP to 6.8%.
Sensex crossed 81,000.
Your SIP is literally betting on India's growth.

The winning formula:

✅ Start small (₹500 works!)
✅ Stay consistent (market timing is a myth)
✅ Think long-term (5+ years minimum)
✅ Review yearly (ensure fund quality)

₹5,000 monthly for 20 years at 14% = ₹75 lakh
₹10,000 monthly for 20 years at 14% = ₹1.5 CRORE

You're not just investing.
You're building financial freedom.

What's your SIP goal for 2025?
