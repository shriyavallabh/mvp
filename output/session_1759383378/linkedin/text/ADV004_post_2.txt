₹500 per month. That's all Ramesh started with in 2015.

Auto driver. Two kids. Monthly income: ₹18,000.

Everyone said "Save for emergencies, don't invest."

He did both. Started ₹500 SIP in equity fund.

10 years later:
• Invested: ₹60,000 total
• Current value: ₹1,47,000
• Daughter: Engineering college (partially funded)

But here's the real story:

→ 2016: Market crash. He continued.
→ 2020: COVID panic. He increased to ₹1000.
→ 2023: Market high. He stayed disciplined.
→ 2025: Portfolio worth 2.45X his investment.

While others with ₹10,000 salary waited for "right time,"
Ramesh with ₹18,000 salary STARTED.

Today, India's SIP story is ₹27,269 CRORE monthly.
That's ₹906 crore invested DAILY by people like Ramesh.

From 2020 to 2025:
• Short-term SIPs (under 1 year): 40% → 21%
• Long-term SIPs (over 5 years): 5% → 30%

Indians are finally thinking long-term.

Your salary doesn't matter.
Your discipline does.

The question isn't "How much should I invest?"
It's "When will I start?"

Ramesh started at ₹500.
What's YOUR excuse?
