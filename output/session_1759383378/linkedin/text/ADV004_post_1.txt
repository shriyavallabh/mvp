Indians are investing ₹906 crore DAILY through SIPs - More than entire IPO amounts!

Let me tell you about Priya.

Age: 26
Salary: ₹6 lakh per year
SIP: Started with ₹1,000

Everyone told her:
"Save for marriage"
"₹1,000 is too small"
"Start when salary increases"

She started anyway. October 2020.

5 years later (October 2025):
Invested: ₹60,000
Current value: ₹1,05,000
Gain: ₹45,000 (75% returns!)

But here's the real win:

→ Built investing habit
→ Learned about markets
→ Increased to ₹3,000/month by 2023
→ Now has ₹2.5 lakh portfolio

She's part of ₹27,269 CRORE monthly SIP movement.
Indians investing ₹906 crore DAILY.

The secret?

Not waiting for "perfect time"
Not waiting for "big salary"
Not waiting for "market bottom"

Just. Starting. Now.

₹500 monthly for 25 years = ₹1.15 crore
₹1,000 monthly for 25 years = ₹2.3 crore

Your coffee budget today.
Your retirement corpus tomorrow.

Priya's advice to beginners?
"Best time to start: 5 years ago.
Second best time: TODAY."
