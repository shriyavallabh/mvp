Plus growth you never got.\n\nThe brutal truth?\n\nYour CA might not tell you this.\nYour bank RM definitely won't.\nEven some advisors miss it.\n\nBut here's what winners do:\n\n1. Max out 80C → ₹1.5L (ELSS/PPF/NPS Tier-I)\n2. Add 80CCD(1B) → Extra ₹50K (NPS only)\n3. Use 80D → Health insurance deductions\n4. Calculate old vs new tax regime\n\nTotal possible tax savings: ₹46,800+ per year.\n\nMarch 31 deadline: 6 months away.\n\nAre you maximizing every rupee?\n\nP.S. That client who lost ₹3L? Now saves ₹50K annually.\nStill regrets not knowing earlier.\n\nVidyadhar Petkar | Your Financial Growth Partner\nARN: ARN-138924\n\n#TaxPlanning #WealthCreation #FinancialFreedom #MutualFunds #NPS",
