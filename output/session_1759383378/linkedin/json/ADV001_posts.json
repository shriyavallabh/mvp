Single. Year.\n\nOver 10 years? ₹7.5 lakhs back in your pocket.\n\nThe deadline: March 31, 2026 (6 months away)\n\nMost wealthy families miss this because:\n❌ Their advisor only knows 80C\n❌ They think NPS is \"too complicated\"\n❌ Nobody explained the health insurance benefit\n\nThis is why expertise matters.\n\nYour wealth isn't just about returns.\nIt's about keeping what you earn.\n\nBuilding Wealth, Creating Trust\nARN: ARN-125847",

Different mindset.\n\nWhen Sensex hit 80,983 yesterday, he didn't panic.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause in 2008, he learned:\n→ Markets recover. Emotions don't.\n→ Time in market > Timing the market\n→ SIPs turn volatility into opportunity\n\nHis portfolio since 2008? Up 380%.\n\nThe ₹15 lakh loss? His ₹2 crore lesson.\n\nHere's what changed:\n1️⃣ Started SIPs during the crash\n2️⃣ Added NPS for tax-free retirement corpus\n3️⃣ Diversified across equity, debt, gold\n4️⃣ Stopped watching TV news daily\n\nMarket corrections will come and go.\n\nBut your investment discipline?\nThat's the only edge you need.\n\nThe brutal truth:\nYour emotions are your portfolio's biggest enemy.\n\nBuilding Wealth, Creating Trust\nARN: ARN-125847",
