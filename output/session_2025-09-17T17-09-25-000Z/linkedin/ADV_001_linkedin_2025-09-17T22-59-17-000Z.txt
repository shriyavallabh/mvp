ðŸ”¥ While Sensex climbs to 82,690, 87% of HNI portfolios still underperform.

Here's what separates the top 13%:

Last week, I reviewed portfolios worth â‚¹500+ crores.

Shocking discovery: Even with +0.38% market gains, most were missing the Information Technology surge (+2.63%).

The difference? Strategic sector allocation.

ðŸ“Š What top performers do differently:

1. **Dynamic Rebalancing**: They move 15-20% allocation based on sector momentum
   â†’ Current focus: Information Technology showing sustained outperformance

2. **Global Diversification**: 25% international exposure hedging rupee volatility
   â†’ Asian markets hitting record highs - perfect entry timing

3. **Tax-Optimized Exits**: Harvesting losses while maintaining sector exposure
   â†’ Saves 12-18% in LTCG through smart switching

4. **Options Overlay**: Conservative covered calls generating 2-3% extra yield
   â†’ Especially powerful in volatile markets like today

Result: 3.5% annual alpha over benchmark consistently.

ðŸ’¡ Portfolio review checklist for this quarter:
âœ… Sector allocation vs benchmark
âœ… International exposure adequacy
âœ… Tax loss harvesting opportunities
âœ… Yield enhancement strategies
