🛡️ No Emergency Fund? You're One Crisis Away from Debt

Life doesn't send calendar invites before surprises.

Before you invest another rupee, answer this:

Can you survive 6 months without salary?

If NO, you need an Emergency Fund NOW.

📊 The Simple Formula:
• Monthly Expenses × 6 = Your Emergency Fund
• Example: ₹40,000 × 6 = ₹2,40,000

Where to Keep It?
✅ Liquid Funds (earn 4-6% vs 3% in savings)
✅ Separate savings account
✅ NOT in stocks or locked investments

How to Build It?
Week 1: Open a separate account
Week 2: Auto-transfer 10% of salary
Month 3: Increase to 20% until goal reached

Real Story: My client avoided a ₹3 lakh loan during medical emergency because of his emergency fund.

Your emergency fund isn't an investment.
It's your financial seat belt. 🚗

Start with ₹1,000 today. Small steps create big safety nets.
