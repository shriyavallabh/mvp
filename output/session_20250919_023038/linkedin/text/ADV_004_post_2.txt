🏛️ Succession Planning: The ₹5 Crore Question

Wealth transfer without planning can lose 30% to taxes.

For portfolios exceeding ₹5 crores, structure matters more than returns.

Advanced Wealth Structuring:

Trust Architecture:

  - Asset protection
  - Succession certainty
  - Tax optimization

• Discretionary Trust
  - Flexibility in distribution

Tax-Efficient Strategies:

1. Systematic Gifting
   → Annual gifts within limits
