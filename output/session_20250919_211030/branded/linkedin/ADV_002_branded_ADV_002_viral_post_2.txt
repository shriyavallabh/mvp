Your ₹200 coffee = ₹67 LAKHS gone.

I'm not joking. Math inside:

Daily Starbucks: ₹200
Monthly: ₹6,000
Yearly: ₹72,000

Invested in SIP for 20 years at 12%:
₹67,21,956

SIXTY SEVEN LAKHS.

But here's what nobody calculates:

Your daily money bleeds:
☕ Coffee (₹200/day) = ₹67 lakhs lost
🚬 Cigarettes (₹150/day) = ₹50 lakhs lost
🍔 Eating out (₹300/day) = ₹1 CRORE lost
🚖 Uber vs Metro (₹200/day) = ₹67 lakhs lost

Total daily waste: ₹850
Wealth destroyed: ₹2.84 CRORES

"But I deserve small pleasures!"

Do you deserve ₹2.84 crores more?

My smartest client's transformation:
2019: Quit smoking → ₹4,500/month saved
2020: Home coffee → ₹5,000/month saved
2021: Home cooking → ₹8,000/month saved
2022: Public transport → ₹6,000/month saved

Total SIP: ₹23,500/month

Current value (5 years): ₹19.4 LAKHS
Projected (20 years total): ₹1.89 CRORES

The formula:
Small daily sacrifice = Massive future wealth

Or keep the coffee.
Stay broke at 60.

Your ₹200 votes every day.
For poverty or prosperity.

Choose wisely.

P.S. I still drink coffee.
But match every ₹200 coffee with ₹200 SIP.
Balance restored.
