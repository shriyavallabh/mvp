✨ Building Wealth, Creating Trust


₹5,000 monthly SIP started by a rickshaw driver.

Today: ₹47 lakhs.

I met Raju in 2012. Monthly income: ₹8,000.
"Saheb, can I also invest?"

Everyone laughed. I didn't.

Started: ₹500
2014: ₹1,000
2016: ₹2,000
Now: ₹5,000

12 years later:
• Invested: ₹3.6 lakhs
• Current value: ₹47 LAKHS
• Daughter: Engineering student

But here's what made me cry:

Raju taught 23 other rickshaw drivers.
Combined wealth created: ₹2.3 CRORES.

From people earning ₹8,000-12,000/month.

The elite say:
"Need ₹50K salary to invest"
"Market is for rich people"
"Poor can't build wealth"

Raju's gang proved them wrong.

Meanwhile, my IT friends (₹1.5L/month):
"Market too volatile yaar"
"Will start next year"
"Salary not enough"

Investments: ZERO
Excuses: UNLIMITED

Raju's formula:
"Rozana 2 sawari ka paisa SIP mein"
(Daily 2 rides money goes to SIP)

₹166/day became ₹47 lakhs.

Your excuse?

P.S. Raju bought his first house.
Cash down: ₹15 lakhs.
Bank manager: "Rickshaw driver with this savings?"

Yes. Because Raju didn't wait for perfect.
He started with possible.

Every rupee counts. Every day matters.
