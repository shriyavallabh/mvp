💔 I sold at 60K. Sensex hit 83K.

Lost ₹2.4 Cr? No. SAVED ₹8 Cr. Here's why:

FPIs dumped ₹1.2L Cr. DIIs pumped same.
Someone's playing musical chairs at 83K.

My father's rule: "Exit when drivers give tips"
My driver yesterday: "Sir, buy IT stocks\!"

Truth: Insiders bought ₹2,800 Cr last month.
They're OUT now. So am I.
