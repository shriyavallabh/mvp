I lost â‚¹15 lakhs in 2008.

Everyone said "Market will recover."
It did. But I had already sold at loss.

Today at Sensex 83014, I see the same fear in clients' eyes.

Here's what 2008 taught me that nobody talks about:

FIIs dumped â‚¹1.2 LAKH CRORE last month.
Biggest capital flight in Indian history.
Yet markets near all-time high.

WHO'S BUYING?

I was in a meeting with 15 family offices.
Combined AUM: â‚¹8,000 crores.

"Let the FIIs panic. We're buying EVERYTHING."

The data is shocking:
â€¢ DIIs pumped in â‚¹1.16 lakh crore
â€¢ Domestic ownership: 17.62% (Historic HIGH)
â€¢ FII ownership: 17.22% (10-year LOW)

For the FIRST TIME IN HISTORY:
Indians own more of India than foreigners.

Pattern recognition:
2008: FII selloff â†’ 300% rally in 3 years
2013: Taper tantrum â†’ 200% gains
2020: Covid panic â†’ 150% rally
2024: They're selling again...

My HNI clients deployed â‚¹450 crores last month.
Average gain already: 12.3%

The brutal truth?

Your emotions are your portfolio's biggest enemy.
Not the market. Not inflation. Not even bad stocks.

When IT is up 2.3% today, everyone's buying.
But real wealth? It's made when everyone's selling.

My â‚¹15 lakh loss became my â‚¹2 crore lesson.

What's yours?

P.S. Still have the screenshot of that loss.
Keeps me humble. And rich.
