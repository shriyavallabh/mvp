But I had already sold at loss.\n\nToday at Sensex 83014, I see the same fear in clients' eyes.\n\nHere's what 2008 taught me that nobody talks about:\n\nFIIs dumped ₹1.2 LAKH CRORE last month.\nBiggest capital flight in Indian history.\nYet markets near all-time high.\n\nWHO'S BUYING?\n\nI was in a meeting with 15 family offices.\nCombined AUM: ₹8,000 crores.\n\n\"Let the FIIs panic. We're buying EVERYTHING.\"\n\nThe data is shocking:\n• DIIs pumped in ₹1.16 lakh crore\n• Domestic ownership: 17.62% (Historic HIGH)\n• FII ownership: 17.22% (10-year LOW)\n\nFor the FIRST TIME IN HISTORY:\nIndians own more of India than foreigners.\n\nPattern recognition:\n2008: FII selloff → 300% rally in 3 years\n2013: Taper tantrum → 200% gains\n2020: Covid panic → 150% rally\n2024: They're selling again...\n\nMy HNI clients deployed ₹450 crores last month.\nAverage gain already: 12.3%\n\nThe brutal truth?\n\nYour emotions are your portfolio's biggest enemy.\nNot the market. Not inflation. Not even bad stocks.\n\nWhen IT is up 2.3% today, everyone's buying.\nBut real wealth? It's made when everyone's selling.\n\nMy ₹15 lakh loss became my ₹2 crore lesson.\n\nWhat's yours?\n\nP.S. Still have the screenshot of that loss.\nKeeps me humble. And rich.\n\nRajesh Kumar | Kumar Wealth Advisors\nBuilding wealth, one lesson at a time\nARN: ARN-12345",
