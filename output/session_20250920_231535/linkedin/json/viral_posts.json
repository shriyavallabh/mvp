      "content": "I watched \u20b92.35 lakh crore leave India in 90 days.\n\nEveryone panicked. \"Markets will crash 40%!\"\n\nIt fell just 3.6%.\n\nHere's the \u20b91.2 lakh crore secret nobody's talking about:\n\nOctober 2024: FIIs start selling. Sensex at 84,500.\nNovember: \u20b962,000 crore exits. Market shakes.\nDecember: Another \u20b932,000 crore gone.\nJanuary 2025: \u20b987,374 crore rushes out.\n\nTotal damage? \u20b91.52 lakh crore ($18 billion) gone.\n\nBut Sensex today? 77378.91. Still standing.\n\nThe plot twist?\n\nWhile foreign giants ran away with \u20b92.35 lakh crores...\nIndian institutions quietly bought \u20b91.2 lakh crores.\n\nDIIs (our insurance companies, mutual funds) became warriors.\nFor every \u20b9100 FIIs sold, DIIs bought \u20b985.\n\nThink about it:\n\n\u2022 Morgan Stanley sells. LIC buys.\n\u2022 Goldman exits. SBI Mutual Fund enters.\n\u2022 Blackrock dumps. HDFC AMC accumulates.\n\nThis isn't just data. It's David vs Goliath.\nAnd David is winning.\n\nMy portfolio dropped 12% in October.\nI added 30% more capital in December.\nToday: Up 18%.\n\nThe lesson 2008 taught me:\n\nWhen institutions fight, retail investors feast.\n\nBut 97% will still sell at the bottom.\nWill you be the 3%?\n\nP.S. My driver started SIP in November when everyone sold.\nHis words: \"Saheb, when rich people run, poor people should walk in.\"\n\nWisdom doesn't need a degree.",

IT sector was $500M.\nToday: $245 billion. 490x growth despite threats.\n\n2018: Trump's first tariff war. IT grew 8.4% that year.\n2020: Pandemic + tariffs. IT boomed 15%.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth?\n\nEvery US threat made Indian IT stronger.\nBecause pressure creates diamonds.\nAnd Indians create jugaad.\n\n3 things happening RIGHT NOW:\n\n1. IT companies opening Mexico offices (nearshoring)\n2. Pivoting to Europe (\u20ac45B opportunity)\n3. AI automation (cut costs by 30%)\n\nYour action plan:\n\n\u2713 IT stocks down 10%? Accumulate leaders\n\u2713 Learn AI/ML in next 90 days\n\u2713 Create multiple income streams\n\nRemember: When Trump tweets, markets overreact.\nSmart money waits. Then strikes.\n\nMy IT portfolio is down 8% this week.\nI'm adding 20% more capital Monday.\n\nBecause I've seen this movie before.\nIt ends with Indian IT at $500 billion by 2030.\n\nTrump or no Trump.",
