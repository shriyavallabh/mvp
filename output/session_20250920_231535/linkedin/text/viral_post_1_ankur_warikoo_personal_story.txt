I watched ₹2.35 lakh crore leave India in 90 days.

I watched ₹2.35 lakh crore leave India in 90 days.

Everyone panicked. "Markets will crash 40%!"

It fell just 3.6%.

Here's the ₹1.2 lakh crore secret nobody's talking about:

October 2024: FIIs start selling. Sensex at 84,500.
November: ₹62,000 crore exits. Market shakes.
December: Another ₹32,000 crore gone.
January 2025: ₹87,374 crore rushes out.

Total damage? ₹1.52 lakh crore ($18 billion) gone.

But Sensex today? 77378.91. Still standing.

The plot twist?

While foreign giants ran away with ₹2.35 lakh crores...
Indian institutions quietly bought ₹1.2 lakh crores.

DIIs (our insurance companies, mutual funds) became warriors.
For every ₹100 FIIs sold, DIIs bought ₹85.

Think about it:

• Morgan Stanley sells. LIC buys.
• Goldman exits. SBI Mutual Fund enters.
• Blackrock dumps. HDFC AMC accumulates.

This isn't just data. It's David vs Goliath.
And David is winning.

My portfolio dropped 12% in October.
I added 30% more capital in December.
Today: Up 18%.

The lesson 2008 taught me:

When institutions fight, retail investors feast.

But 97% will still sell at the bottom.
Will you be the 3%?

P.S. My driver started SIP in November when everyone sold.
His words: "Saheb, when rich people run, poor people should walk in."

Wisdom doesn't need a degree.
