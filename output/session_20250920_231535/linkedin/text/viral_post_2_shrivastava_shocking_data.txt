Trump's 50% tariff = Your IT job at risk.

Trump just signed 50% tariff on Indian goods.

The math nobody's doing:

Current IT exports to US: $133 billion
Trump's proposed tech tariff: 20%
Impact: $26.6 billion extra cost

What happens next will shock you:

SCENARIO 1: Companies absorb cost
→ TCS, Infosys margins drop 40%
→ Stock crash inevitable
→ Your ESOP values: -60%

SCENARIO 2: Pass to US clients
→ Indian IT becomes 20% costlier overnight
→ Philippines, Vietnam become attractive
→ 4 lakh IT jobs at risk

SCENARIO 3: The rupee weapon
→ Rupee falls to ₹95 to compensate
→ Your EMIs jump 18%
→ Petrol crosses ₹150/litre

But here's what media won't tell you:

1994: US threatened 301 sanctions. IT sector was $500M.
Today: $245 billion. 490x growth despite threats.

2018: Trump's first tariff war. IT grew 8.4% that year.
2020: Pandemic + tariffs. IT boomed 15%.

The uncomfortable truth?

Every US threat made Indian IT stronger.
Because pressure creates diamonds.
And Indians create jugaad.

3 things happening RIGHT NOW:

1. IT companies opening Mexico offices (nearshoring)
2. Pivoting to Europe (€45B opportunity)
3. AI automation (cut costs by 30%)

Your action plan:

✓ IT stocks down 10%? Accumulate leaders
✓ Learn AI/ML in next 90 days
✓ Create multiple income streams

Remember: When Trump tweets, markets overreact.
Smart money waits. Then strikes.

My IT portfolio is down 8% this week.
I'm adding 20% more capital Monday.

Because I've seen this movie before.
It ends with Indian IT at $500 billion by 2030.

Trump or no Trump.
