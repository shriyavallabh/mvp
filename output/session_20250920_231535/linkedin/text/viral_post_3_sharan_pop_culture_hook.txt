Bitcoin crashed $14,856. My Uber driver still made money.

Bitcoin crashed $14,856. My Uber driver still made money.

How? The strategy big investors hate:

Jan 17: Bitcoin at $109,356 (all-time high)
Jan 20: Crashes to $94,500
Loss: 13.6% in 72 hours

My Uber driver Rajesh:
"Sir, I made 22% profit."

I nearly fell off my seat.

His insane strategy:

Week 1 (Bitcoin at $102K): Bought ₹500
Week 2 (Bitcoin at $105K): Sold ₹500 worth
Week 3 (Bitcoin at $109K): Sold another ₹500
Week 4 (Bitcoin crashes): Still has ₹2,000 invested

Net result:
• Recovered ₹1,000 capital
• Playing with profits only
• Zero stress during crash

This is called "Rupee Cost Averaging OUT"

What crypto bros won't tell you:

• 89% lose money trying to time Bitcoin
• 73% panic sell during corrections
• 94% buy at peaks (FOMO)

But Rajesh? 8th standard pass.
Never read a single whitepaper.
Just common sense.

The framework:

1. Invest only cigarette money (what you can burn)
2. Book 20% capital every 10% rise
3. Never check prices after 9 PM (sleep matters)
4. When everyone's buying, you're selling
5. When crashes happen, you're already safe

Real data that'll blow your mind:

If you bought Bitcoin:
• Every crash since 2017: Up 847% average
• Only at peaks: Down 34%
• Rajesh style (SIP + booking): Up 127%

My crypto allocation: 2% of portfolio
Rajesh's allocation: ₹2,000 (his drinking budget)

Who's the smarter investor?

Next time your Uber driver gives you tips...
Maybe listen.

They see what MBA finance bros miss:
Simple > Complex
Discipline > Intelligence
Peace > Profits

P.S. Rajesh is now teaching his building watchman.
The watchman is up 18%.

The revolution isn't coming.
It's here.
In Ubers and chawls.
