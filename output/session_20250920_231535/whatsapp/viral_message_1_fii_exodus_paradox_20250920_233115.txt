â‚¹2.35 LAKH CRORE left. Market still UP! ðŸ˜±

I lost â‚¹7 lakhs panicking when FIIs sold.
Today learned the SECRET buyer...

DIIs bought EVERY share FIIs dumped!
â‚¹86,000 crore domestic money vs foreign fear.

My driver didn't sell. He's up 12%.
I'm down 15%. Who's smarter?

Lesson: Indian money > Foreign panic
