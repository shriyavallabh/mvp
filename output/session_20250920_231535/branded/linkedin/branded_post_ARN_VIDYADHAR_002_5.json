  "content": "Trump just signed 50% tariff on Indian goods.\n\nThe math nobody's doing:\n\nCurrent IT exports to US: $133 billion\nTrump's proposed tech tariff: 20%\nImpact: $26.6 billion extra cost\n\nWhat happens next will shock you:\n\nSCENARIO 1: Companies absorb cost\n→ TCS, Infosys margins drop 40%\n→ Stock crash inevitable\n→ Your ESOP values: -60%\n\nSCENARIO 2: Pass to US clients\n→ Indian IT becomes 20% costlier overnight\n→ Philippines, Vietnam become attractive\n→ 4 lakh IT jobs at risk\n\nSCENARIO 3: The rupee weapon\n→ Rupee falls to ₹95 to compensate\n→ Your EMIs jump 18%\n→ Petrol crosses ₹150/litre\n\nBut here's what media won't tell you:\n\n1994: US threatened 301 sanctions. IT sector was $500M.\nToday: $245 billion. 490x growth despite threats.\n\n2018: Trump's first tariff war. IT grew 8.4% that year.\n2020: Pandemic + tariffs. IT boomed 15%.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth?\n\nEvery US threat made Indian IT stronger.\nBecause pressure creates diamonds.\nAnd Indians create jugaad.\n\n3 things happening RIGHT NOW:\n\n1. IT companies opening Mexico offices (nearshoring)\n2. Pivoting to Europe (€45B opportunity)\n3. AI automation (cut costs by 30%)\n\nYour action plan:\n\n✓ IT stocks down 10%? Accumulate leaders\n✓ Learn AI/ML in next 90 days\n✓ Create multiple income streams\n\nRemember: When Trump tweets, markets overreact.\nSmart money waits. Then strikes.\n\nMy IT portfolio is down 8% this week.\nI'm adding 20% more capital Monday.\n\nBecause I've seen this movie before.\nIt ends with Indian IT at $500 billion by 2030.\n\nTrump or no Trump.\n\n---\nVidyadhar Petkar\nVidyadhar Petkar\nBuilding Wealth, Creating Trust\nARN: ARN_VIDYADHAR_002\n\nMutual fund investments are subject to market risks.",
