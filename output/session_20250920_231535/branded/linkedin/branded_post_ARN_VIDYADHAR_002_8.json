  "content": "Bitcoin crashed $14,856. My Uber driver still made money.\n\nHow? The strategy big investors hate:\n\nJan 17: Bitcoin at $109,356 (all-time high)\nJan 20: Crashes to $94,500\nLoss: 13.6% in 72 hours\n\nMy Uber driver Rajesh:\n\"Sir, I made 22% profit.\"\n\nI nearly fell off my seat.\n\nHis insane strategy:\n\nWeek 1 (Bitcoin at $102K): Bought ₹500\nWeek 2 (Bitcoin at $105K): Sold ₹500 worth\nWeek 3 (Bitcoin at $109K): Sold another ₹500\nWeek 4 (Bitcoin crashes): Still has ₹2,000 invested\n\nNet result:\n• Recovered ₹1,000 capital\n• Playing with profits only\n• Zero stress during crash\n\nThis is called \"Rupee Cost Averaging OUT\"\n\nWhat crypto bros won't tell you:\n\n• 89% lose money trying to time Bitcoin\n• 73% panic sell during corrections\n• 94% buy at peaks (FOMO)\n\nBut Rajesh? 8th standard pass.\nNever read a single whitepaper.\nJust common sense.\n\nThe framework:\n\n1. Invest only cigarette money (what you can burn)\n2. Book 20% capital every 10% rise\n3. Never check prices after 9 PM (sleep matters)\n4. When everyone's buying, you're selling\n5. When crashes happen, you're already safe\n\nReal data that'll blow your mind:\n\nIf you bought Bitcoin:\n• Every crash since 2017: Up 847% average\n• Only at peaks: Down 34%\n• Rajesh style (SIP + booking): Up 127%\n\nMy crypto allocation: 2% of portfolio\nRajesh's allocation: ₹2,000 (his drinking budget)\n\nWho's the smarter investor?\n\nNext time your Uber driver gives you tips...\nMaybe listen.\n\nThey see what MBA finance bros miss:\nSimple > Complex\nDiscipline > Intelligence\nPeace > Profits\n\nP.S. Rajesh is now teaching his building watchman.\nThe watchman is up 18%.\n\nThe revolution isn't coming.\nIt's here.\nIn Ubers and chawls.\n\n---\nVidyadhar Petkar\nVidyadhar Petkar\nBuilding Wealth, Creating Trust\nARN: ARN_VIDYADHAR_002\n\nMutual fund investments are subject to market risks.",
