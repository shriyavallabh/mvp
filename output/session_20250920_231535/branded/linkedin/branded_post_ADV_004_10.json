  "content": "I watched ₹2.35 lakh crore leave India in 90 days.\n\nEveryone panicked. \"Markets will crash 40%!\"\n\nIt fell just 3.6%.\n\nHere's the ₹1.2 lakh crore secret nobody's talking about:\n\nOctober 2024: FIIs start selling. Sensex at 84,500.\nNovember: ₹62,000 crore exits. Market shakes.\nDecember: Another ₹32,000 crore gone.\nJanuary 2025: ₹87,374 crore rushes out.\n\nTotal damage? ₹1.52 lakh crore ($18 billion) gone.\n\nBut Sensex today? 77378.91. Still standing.\n\nThe plot twist?\n\nWhile foreign giants ran away with ₹2.35 lakh crores...\nIndian institutions quietly bought ₹1.2 lakh crores.\n\nDIIs (our insurance companies, mutual funds) became warriors.\nFor every ₹100 FIIs sold, DIIs bought ₹85.\n\nThink about it:\n\n• Morgan Stanley sells. LIC buys.\n• Goldman exits. SBI Mutual Fund enters.\n• Blackrock dumps. HDFC AMC accumulates.\n\nThis isn't just data. It's David vs Goliath.\nAnd David is winning.\n\nMy portfolio dropped 12% in October.\nI added 30% more capital in December.\nToday: Up 18%.\n\nThe lesson 2008 taught me:\n\nWhen institutions fight, retail investors feast.\n\nBut 97% will still sell at the bottom.\nWill you be the 3%?\n\nP.S. My driver started SIP in November when everyone sold.\nHis words: \"Saheb, when rich people run, poor people should walk in.\"\n\nWisdom doesn't need a degree.\n\n---\nMr. Tranquil Veda\nTranquil Wealth Advisory\nCreating Peaceful Wealth Journey\nARN: ADV_004\n\nMutual fund investments are subject to market risks.
