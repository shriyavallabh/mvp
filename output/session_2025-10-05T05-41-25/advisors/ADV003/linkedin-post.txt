🎯 The Nifty 50 just crossed 25,000 - but here's what most investors miss...

Everyone's celebrating the new high. But smart investors are asking different questions:

📊 Key Insights:
• Large-cap indices up 18% YTD
• Mid-caps outperforming at 24%
• Small-caps showing volatility at 28%

🔍 What This Means for You:

If you started SIPs in 2020:
→ Your Rs 10,000/month is now worth Rs 6.2L (vs Rs 4.8L invested)
→ That's 29% CAGR - beating FD returns by 3x

If you're sitting in cash:
→ Inflation ate 6.2% of your purchasing power
→ Opportunity cost: Rs 1.2L on every Rs 10L parked

💡 The Real Question:
It's not about timing the market high.
It's about time IN the market.

Your move:
1️⃣ Review your asset allocation
2️⃣ Ensure you're not over-exposed to one sector
3️⃣ Continue your SIPs (yes, even at the high)

Remember: Nifty crossed 10,000 in 2017. Everyone said "too high."
If you waited, you missed 150% returns.
