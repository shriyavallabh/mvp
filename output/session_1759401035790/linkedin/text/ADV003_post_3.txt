Your ₹10 chai just taught you a ₹10 crore lesson.

Inflation today: 2.1% (lowest in 6 years)
Your FD returns: 6.6%

First time in 6 years your savings are beating inflation.

But here's the REAL story:

Raju bhaiya sells 300 chai daily.
₹10 each. ₹3,000/day. ₹90,000/month.

Started SIP: ₹5,000/month in 2015.

10 years later:
• Invested: ₹6 lakhs
• Current value: ₹14.2 lakhs
• He owns the tea stall now.

Meanwhile, Sharma ji's son:
• MBA from tier-1 college
• ₹30 lakh education loan
• ₹12 LPA salary
• Zero investments
• Still paying EMIs

The chaiwala's SIP > MBA's salary.

Why?

Because Raju understood something Sharma ji's son didn't:

"₹10 chai inflates 2.1% yearly.
₹10 invested compounds 12% yearly."

Gold gave 176% returns in 10 years.
FDs gave 60%.

Raju's mutual funds? 137% returns.

He didn't wait for:
→ "Right time to invest"
→ "Market to correct"
→ "Salary to increase"

He started with what he had.
₹5,000 from selling chai.

Your excuse is what exactly?

You earn 10x Raju's income.
But Raju's wealth is growing faster.

Not because he earns more.
Because he invests consistently.

The MBA degree doesn't build wealth.
The discipline does.

Raju will retire with ₹2+ crores at this rate.
Will Sharma ji's son?

Start your ₹5,000 SIP today.
Or keep buying ₹10 chai and funding Raju's retirement.

Your choice.

P.S. Raju now suggests good mutual funds to his customers.
Sharma ji's son still Googles "best SIP to start."
