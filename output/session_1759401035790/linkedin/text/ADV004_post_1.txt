TCS lost ₹97,598 crore today.

That's bigger than many company's total value!

Why did this happen?
→ US increased H1B visa fees to $100,000
→ IT companies will face higher costs
→ Investors got worried and sold

The Simple Lesson:

Don't put all money in one sector.

If you have too much IT stocks:
✅ Book some profits
✅ Move to other sectors
✅ Keep portfolio balanced

Smart investors had:
→ Some IT stocks (went down)
→ Some bank stocks (went up)
→ Overall portfolio stayed stable

One sector fell. Other rose.
That's called diversification.

Your Action Today:

Check your investments.
If one sector is more than 30%, rebalance it.

Spread your money across:
→ Banking
→ IT
→ FMCG
→ Healthcare

When one falls, others protect you.

Stay smart. Stay diversified.
