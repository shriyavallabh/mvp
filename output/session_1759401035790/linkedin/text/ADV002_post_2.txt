Gold: 176% returns in 10 years
Fixed Deposits: 60% returns in 10 years

Your parents were right about gold.
Your bank was wrong about FDs.

The math that nobody shows you:

₹1 lakh in Gold (2015):
→ Worth ₹2.76 lakhs today
→ Tax-free if held as jewelry
→ Hedge against inflation

₹1 lakh in FD (2015):
→ Worth ₹1.60 lakhs today
→ Tax on interest (30% for HNI)
→ Lost to inflation

But here's the smarter play:

₹1 lakh in Gold ETF/SGB (2015):
→ Worth ₹2.76 lakhs (same as physical)
→ No storage cost
→ Easy to liquidate
→ Better tax treatment (LTCG after 3 years)

The lesson?

Physical gold = Emotional security
Gold ETF/SGB = Wealth building

Your grandparents bought gold for weddings.
You should buy gold for wealth.

Action steps:

1. Keep 10-15% portfolio in gold
2. Use Gold ETF or Sovereign Gold Bonds
3. SIP in gold (yes, it's possible!)
4. Rebalance when it crosses 20%

Gold isn't just jewelry.
It's a strategic asset class.

Start treating it like one.
