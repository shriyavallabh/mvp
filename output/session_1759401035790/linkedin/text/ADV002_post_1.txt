TCS lost ₹97,598 crore market cap today.

Infosys down -6.2%.
Wipro bleeding -5.8%.

Reason? US H1B visa fees jumped to $100,000.

Here's what this teaches us:

1️⃣ Global Policy = Local Impact
→ One US decision wiped IT sector value
→ Your portfolio needs geographic diversity

2️⃣ Sector Concentration Risk
→ IT stocks down 7.34%
→ PSU banks up 2.5%
→ Diversification saved portfolios today

3️⃣ Market Rotation
→ Money moved from IT to Oil & Gas
→ Smart investors follow the flow
→ Rigid portfolios suffer

The investors who survived today had:
✅ Maximum 20% in one sector
✅ Mix of domestic + export stocks
✅ Defensive holdings (FMCG, Pharma)

The ones who panicked:
❌ 50%+ in IT stocks
❌ No hedge positions
❌ Emotional selling at loss

Your homework today:

Check your portfolio sector allocation.
If any sector > 25%, rebalance now.

Tomorrow's crash won't wait for you to learn this lesson.
