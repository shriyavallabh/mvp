I watched ₹97,598 crore vanish in one morning.

Not from my portfolio.
From TCS shareholders.

-8.5% drop because US raised H1B visa fees to $100,000.

One policy. 97,598 crore gone.

This reminded me of 2008.

I lost ₹12 lakhs in Satyam. Everyone said "blue chip can't fail."
They did.

Today's lesson nobody talks about:

→ No stock is "too big to fall"
→ Diversification isn't optional, it's survival
→ Global policy = Indian market reality

When TCS, India's crown jewel, can lose ₹1 lakh crore in market cap...

Your "safe" portfolio needs a second look.

The investors who survived today?

They weren't in just IT.
They weren't in just one sector.
They had boring, diversified portfolios.

While others panic-sold TCS at -8.5%,
Smart money bought PSU banks at +2.5%.

Market crashes don't destroy wealth.
Concentration does.

What's your Plan B when your largest holding drops 8% overnight?

P.S. Still think "putting all eggs in one basket and watching it carefully" works?
TCS holders watched very carefully today. Still lost ₹97,598 crore.
