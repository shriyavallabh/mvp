Everyone said \"blue chip can't fail.\"\nThey did.\n\nToday's lesson nobody talks about:\n\n→ No stock is \"too big to fall\"\n→ Diversification isn't optional, it's survival\n→ Global policy = Indian market reality\n\nWhen TCS, India's crown jewel, can lose ₹1 lakh crore in market cap...\n\nYour \"safe\" portfolio needs a second look.\n\nThe investors who survived today?\n\nThey weren't in just IT.\nThey weren't in just one sector.\nThey had boring, diversified portfolios.\n\nWhile others panic-sold TCS at -8.5%,\nSmart money bought PSU banks at +2.5%.\n\nMarket crashes don't destroy wealth.\nConcentration does.\n\nWhat's your Plan B when your largest holding drops 8% overnight?\n\nP.S. Still think \"putting all eggs in one basket and watching it carefully\" works?\nTCS holders watched very carefully today. Still lost ₹97,598 crore.\n\nShruti Petkar | ARN-125847\nBuilding Resilient Portfolios, One Lesson at a Time\n\n#InvestmentLessons #RiskManagement #PortfolioDiversification #WealthProtection\n\nARN: ARN-125847\nMutual fund investments are subject to market risks.
