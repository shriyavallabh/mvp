Banking Stocks Recovery - Should You Enter?

🏦 Banking sector up 2.1% today! Many asking: 'Should I invest?'

Let me break it down simply:

✅ WHY BANKS ARE RISING:
• Interest rates stabilizing
• Loan growth improving
• Bad loans reducing
• Kotak Bank up 2.67% today!

📊 FOR ₹8 LAKH PORTFOLIOS:

SAFE APPROACH (My recommendation):
• 20% in banking sector funds
• Focus on large banks (HDFC, ICICI, Kotak)
• Avoid risky small banks
• Use SIP, not lumpsum

💡 SMART ENTRY STRATEGY:
• Week 1: Invest 25%
• Week 2: Invest 25%
• Week 3: Invest 25%
• Week 4: Invest 25%
(This averages your entry price)

⚠️ RISKS TO KNOW:
• If economy slows, banks suffer first
• Keep max 25% in banking sector
• Don't chase quick gains

🎯 BEGINNER-FRIENDLY OPTIONS:
1. Banking sector mutual funds
2. Nifty Bank Index Fund
3. HDFC Bank for direct equity

My view: Good for long-term (3+ years), not for quick profits.
