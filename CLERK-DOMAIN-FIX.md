- ‚úÖ CLERK_SECRET_KEY ‚Üí Correct key for MVP App
- ‚úÖ Deployed to production
- ‚úÖ Verified deployment live (age: 0, fresh deployment)

## üö® New Issue Discovered

**CORS Errors on Production**:
```
Access to script at 'https://touched-adder-72.clerk.accounts.dev/npm/@clerk/clerk-js@5/dist/clerk.browser.js'
from origin 'https://jarvisdaily.com' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Root Cause**: `jarvisdaily.com` is **NOT** in the Clerk dashboard's allowed domains list.

---

## üîß REQUIRED FIX (Clerk Dashboard)

### Step 1: Login to Clerk Dashboard

**URL**: https://dashboard.clerk.com/apps/app_2rLf8qF0PNrGw9UQVPBBSJj3C9a

**Credentials**: Use your Clerk account

### Step 2: Navigate to Domains

1. Select project: **"touched-adder-72"** (MVP App)
2. Go to: **"Domains"** or **"Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"**
3. Look for section: **"Allowed Origins"** or **"CORS Origins"**

### Step 3: Add Production Domain

Add these domains to the allowed list:

```
https://jarvisdaily.com
https://*.jarvisdaily.com
https://finadvise-webhook.vercel.app
https://*.vercel.app
```

**Important**: Include protocol (`https://`) and wildcards for subdomains

### Step 4: Save Changes

Click **"Save"** or **"Update"** in Clerk dashboard

---

## Alternative: Check Current Clerk Configuration

Run this command to see current Clerk project settings:

```bash
# Check which domains are configured in Clerk
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_NSI6Ch5M4SvObAMkj4rNpQwjSbc23XN8tG1zY0LFiC" \
  https://api.clerk.com/v1/instance
```

---

## Verification After Fix

Once domains are added in Clerk dashboard, test again:

```bash
# Test production signup
npx playwright test tests/auth-production.spec.js

# Expected: NO CORS errors
# Expected: Signup works and redirects to /onboarding
```

Manual test:
```bash
open https://jarvisdaily.com/signup
# Fill form and create account
# Should work without errors
```

---

## Why This Happened

1. **Clerk Project Security**: Clerk restricts which domains can use the API keys
2. **Default Configuration**: New Clerk projects only allow `localhost` by default
3. **Production Domain**: `jarvisdaily.com` was never added to allowed list
4. **CORS Enforcement**: Browser blocks cross-origin requests for security
