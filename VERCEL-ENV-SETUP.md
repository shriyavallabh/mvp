## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Production Signup Not Working Without These

## üöÄ Quick Fix (5 minutes)

1. Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **finadvise-webhook**
3. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**

### **Step 2: Add Clerk Keys**

Add these **TWO** environment variables:

#### **Variable 1:**

Value: pk_test_dG91Y2hlZC1hZGRlci03Mi5jbGVyay5hY2NvdW50cy5kZXYk
Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all)
```

#### **Variable 2:**

Name: CLERK_SECRET_KEY
Value: sk_test_NSI6Ch5M4SvObAMkj4rNpQwjSbc23XN8tG1zY0LFiC
Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all)
```

### **Step 3: Redeploy**

After adding environment variables:

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to create account"

**Possible Causes:**
1. ‚ùå Environment variables not set in Vercel
2. ‚ùå Deployment didn't include new environment variables
3. ‚ùå Clerk publishable key domain mismatch

**Solution:**
1. Verify env vars in Vercel dashboard
2. Force redeploy
3. Check Clerk dashboard allowed domains include `jarvisdaily.com`

### Issue: "publishableKey is required"

**Solution:**
- Environment variable name must be **exactly**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- Must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for client-side access
- Redeploy after adding

### Issue: Signup works locally but not in production

**Solution:**
- This is **exactly** the environment variable issue
- Local uses `.env.local`
- Production uses Vercel environment variables
- **Must** add keys to Vercel dashboard

## üéØ Expected Behavior After Fix

### **Before Fix (Current):**
‚ùå Visit jarvisdaily.com/signup
‚ùå Fill form and click "Create Account"

‚ùå Console: "publishableKey is required" or Clerk initialization error

## üîê Security Note

**DO NOT** commit `.env.local` or `.env.production` to Git if they contain sensitive keys.

Current `.gitignore` should already exclude:
```
.env*.local
.env.production
```

Vercel environment variables are **secure** and **encrypted**.

## üìû Need Help?

1. Check Vercel deployment logs:

3. Verify Clerk Dashboard settings:
   - Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com/
   - Check **Allowed Redirect URLs**
   - Check **Allowed Origins**
