# MSG91 SMS OTP Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Code Integration: COMPLETE

I've already integrated MSG91 into your codebase. Now you just need to get your credentials and we'll test!

---

## Step-by-Step: Get MSG91 Credentials

### STEP 1: Create MSG91 Account (5 minutes)

1. **Go to**: https://control.msg91.com/signup/

2. **Fill the form**:
   - Name: Your name
   - Email: Your email
   - Mobile: **9765071249** (without +91)
   - Company: JarvisDaily
   - Password: Create a strong password

3. **Click "Create Free Account"**

4. **Verify your email**:
   - Check your inbox (and spam folder)
   - Click the verification link

5. **Verify your mobile**:
   - MSG91 will send you an OTP on +919765071249
   - Enter the OTP to verify

‚úÖ **You'll get 100 FREE SMS credits** for testing!

---

### STEP 2: Get Your Auth Key (2 minutes)

1. **After login**, go to: https://control.msg91.com/app/settings/api

2. **You'll see "Auth Key"** displayed on the page
   - It looks like: `376025AabcdefghijklmnopqrP1234567`
   - **COPY THIS KEY**

3. **Send me this Auth Key** and I'll add it to the .env file

---

### STEP 3: Create OTP Template (OPTIONAL - Can do later)

**Note**: For testing, you can skip this. MSG91 has a default template. But for production, you should create your own.

1. **Go to**: https://control.msg91.com/app/templates

2. **Click "Create Template"**

3. **Fill the form**:
   - Template Name: `JarvisDaily OTP`
   - Template Type: **Transactional**
   - Message: `Your JarvisDaily OTP is {#var#}. Valid for 5 minutes. Do not share this code.`
   - Variable: `{#var#}` (this will be replaced with actual OTP)

4. **Submit** and wait for approval (usually instant)

5. **Copy the Template ID** (you'll get this after approval)

---

### STEP 4: DLT Registration (Required for Production in India)

**What is DLT?**
- Do Not Call (DND) Registry mandated by TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India)
- Required for sending commercial SMS in India
- **Takes 2-3 days for approval**

**For now**: Skip this. MSG91 will work without DLT for testing.

**For production**: Follow this guide: https://help.msg91.com/article/177-dlt-registration

## What I Need From You

Once you complete STEP 1 and STEP 2, send me:

1. ‚úÖ **MSG91 Auth Key**: `376025A...` (from the API settings page)

I'll then:
