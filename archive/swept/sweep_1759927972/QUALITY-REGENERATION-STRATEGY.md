# Quality Regeneration Strategy - 99.999% Template Avoidance

## Goal: Never Use Templates (Except True Emergencies)

**Target**: <0.001% template usage (1 in 100,000 generations)
**Method**: Aggressive regeneration with escalating improvements

---

## Current Problem

**Old Strategy**:
```
Generate → Score 7.3 → Regen (8.2) → Regen (8.7) → ❌ USE TEMPLATE
```

**Issues**:
- Only 2 regeneration attempts
- Same improvement strategy each time
- Gives up too easily
- Templates used ~5% of the time ❌

---

## New Strategy: Aggressive Regeneration

### Level 1: Smart Regeneration (Max 5 Attempts)

```
Generate Content
    ↓
Score: 7.3/10 ❌
    ↓
Attempt 1: Targeted Improvements (weak dimensions)
    → "Add emotion + stronger CTA"
    ↓
Score: 8.2/10 ❌
    ↓
Attempt 2: Escalate Improvements (proven formulas)
    → "Use Warikoo storytelling + Ranade analogy"
    ↓
Score: 8.7/10 ❌
    ↓
Attempt 3: Nuclear Option (all proven strategies)
    → "Shocking stat hook + vulnerability story + FOMO CTA"
    ↓
Score: 9.1/10 ✅ SUCCESS!
```

**Key Changes**:
- Increase max attempts: 2 → **5**
- Escalate strategy each attempt (not just repeat)
- Use proven viral formulas from session data

### Level 2: Style Switching (If Still Failing)

```
Attempt 4: Switch Content Style
    → If "educational" failing, try "emotional story"
    → If "data-driven" failing, try "client story"
    ↓
Score: 8.9/10 ❌
    ↓
Attempt 5: Hybrid Best-of-Best
    → Combine top hooks from session history
    → Use highest-scoring story patterns
    ↓
Score: 9.3/10 ✅ SUCCESS!
```

### Level 3: Human Review (Before Template)

```
Attempt 5 Failed → Score: 8.8/10 ❌
    ↓
PAUSE AUTOMATION
    ↓
Alert: "Asset stuck at 8.8/10 after 5 attempts"
    ↓
Options:
    1. Manual approval (8.8 is close enough)
    2. Manual editing (human improves to 9.0+)
    3. Delay distribution (try again tomorrow)
    4. ONLY IF URGENT: Use template
```

## Regeneration Escalation Levels

### Attempt 1: Targeted Dimension Fixes
```python
# Fix specific weak dimensions
if emotion < 8.0:
    prompt += "Add emotional vulnerability or aspiration"
if cta < 8.0:
    prompt += "Make CTA urgent with FOMO trigger"
```

### Attempt 2: Proven Formula Injection
```python
# Use proven viral strategies
strategies = [
    "Warikoo storytelling: Personal loss → lesson learned",
    "Ranade analogy: Complex concept → simple comparison",
    "Shrivastava data: Shocking statistic → explanation"
]
prompt += f"Apply this proven strategy: {random.choice(strategies)}"
```

### Attempt 3: Top Performer Cloning
```python
# Clone structure from session's highest scorer
top_post = get_highest_scoring_asset(session, content_type)
prompt += f"""
Study this 9.8/10 example structure:
- Hook pattern: {top_post.hook}
- Story arc: {top_post.story_structure}
- Emotional trigger: {top_post.emotion_type}

Create NEW content using SAME pattern (different topic/data)
"""
```

### Attempt 4: Style Switching
```python
# If current style failing, try opposite
current_style = asset.metadata['style']  # e.g., "data-driven"

style_alternatives = {
    "data-driven": "emotional_story",
    "emotional_story": "contrarian_wisdom",
    "educational": "client_case_study",
    "client_case_study": "philosophical"
}

new_style = style_alternatives[current_style]
prompt += f"COMPLETELY CHANGE APPROACH: Use {new_style} style instead"
```

### Attempt 5: AI Meta-Analysis
```python
# Ask AI to analyze why previous attempts failed
analysis_prompt = f"""
Previous 4 attempts all scored 8.0-8.9 but not 9.0+.

Attempt 1 (8.2): {attempt1_content}
Attempt 2 (8.7): {attempt2_content}
Attempt 3 (8.8): {attempt3_content}
Attempt 4 (8.9): {attempt4_content}

What is the FUNDAMENTAL issue preventing 9.0+?
What radical change is needed?

Generate content that solves this root cause.
"""
```

## Emergency Template Triggers (Only These!)

Templates should ONLY be used when:

### 1. Technical Failures (Not Quality Issues)
```
✅ API timeout (Gemini/Claude unavailable)
✅ Rate limit exceeded (too many requests)
✅ Service outage (infrastructure down)

❌ Content quality below 9.0 → KEEP REGENERATING
```

### 2. Time-Critical Situations
```
✅ Advisor needs content in <5 minutes (emergency)
✅ Market crash breaking news (distribute immediately)

❌ Scheduled daily content → Use regeneration
```

### 3. After Human Review Decision
```
✅ Human reviewed 5 attempts, says "use template"
✅ Human manually approves "skip this advisor today"

❌ Automated decision → Never use template
```

---

## Implementation Changes

### Update quality-regeneration-loop.py

**OLD CODE**:
```python
self.max_attempts = 2  # ❌ Too few

def regenerate_asset(self, asset, attempt=1):
    # Same improvement prompt each time ❌
    prompt = self.generate_regeneration_prompt(asset)
```

**NEW CODE**:
```python
self.max_attempts = 5  # ✅ More attempts
self.escalation_strategies = [
    'targeted_fixes',
    'proven_formulas',
    'top_performer_clone',
    'style_switch',
    'ai_meta_analysis'
]

def regenerate_asset(self, asset, attempt=1):
    # ESCALATE strategy based on attempt number
    strategy = self.escalation_strategies[attempt - 1]

    if strategy == 'targeted_fixes':
        prompt = self.generate_targeted_improvements(asset)
    elif strategy == 'proven_formulas':
        prompt = self.inject_proven_formulas(asset)
    elif strategy == 'top_performer_clone':
        prompt = self.clone_top_performer_structure(asset)
    elif strategy == 'style_switch':
        prompt = self.switch_content_style(asset)
    elif strategy == 'ai_meta_analysis':
        prompt = self.ai_analyze_failure_pattern(asset)
```

### Add Human Review Gate

**BEFORE Templates**:
```python
if attempts >= 5 and score < 9.0:
    # STOP - Don't auto-use template

    # Alert for human review
    alert = {
        'severity': 'HIGH',
        'message': f'Asset stuck at {score}/10 after 5 attempts',
        'asset_id': asset['id'],
        'advisor': asset['advisor'],
        'content_preview': asset['content'][:200],
        'options': [
            'approve_current_version',    # Accept 8.8/10
            'manual_edit',                # Human improves it
            'skip_advisor_today',         # No content for this advisor
            'use_emergency_template'      # LAST RESORT
        ]
    }

    send_alert_to_admin(alert)

    # WAIT for human decision (don't auto-proceed to template)
    return PENDING_HUMAN_REVIEW
```

### Slack/Email Alerts

**Only alert on**:
- Asset reaches attempt 5 without success
- Template about to be used (requires approval)
- Unusual pattern (multiple advisors failing)

**Don't alert on**:
- Routine regenerations (attempts 1-3)
- Successful content generation
- Normal quality variations

---

## Template Library Philosophy

### Keep Templates, But Make Them Hard to Use

**Strategy**: Templates exist but require:
1. **5 regeneration attempts** (not 2)
2. **Human approval** (not automatic)
3. **Logging/justification** (why template needed)

**Analogy**: Like nuclear launch codes
- Codes exist (templates available)
- Multiple keys needed (5 attempts + human approval)
- Used only in true emergency (0.001% of time)

### Template Maintenance

Since templates are rarely used:
- **Don't create all 12 now** (waste of effort)
- **Create on-demand** (when actually needed)
- **Review annually** (not monthly)

**Current 3 templates are sufficient** for emergency coverage.

---

## Configuration Changes

### Update quality-scorer threshold behavior

**OLD**:
```python
QUALITY_THRESHOLD = 9.0  # Hard threshold
MAX_ATTEMPTS = 2          # Give up quickly
```

**NEW**:
```python
QUALITY_THRESHOLD = 9.0   # Target threshold
ACCEPTABLE_THRESHOLD = 8.5 # With human approval
MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5          # Try harder
HUMAN_REVIEW_THRESHOLD = 8.5  # Close enough for review
TEMPLATE_THRESHOLD = 0    # Never auto-use templates
```

### Add attempt escalation config

```python
ESCALATION_CONFIG = {
    'attempt_1': {
        'strategy': 'targeted_fixes',
        'min_improvement': 0.5,  # Must improve by 0.5
        'timeout': 60            # 60 seconds max
    },
    'attempt_2': {
        'strategy': 'proven_formulas',
        'min_improvement': 0.3,
        'timeout': 90
    },
    'attempt_3': {
        'strategy': 'top_performer_clone',
        'min_improvement': 0.2,
        'timeout': 120
    },
    'attempt_4': {
        'strategy': 'style_switch',
        'min_improvement': 0.2,
        'timeout': 120
    },
    'attempt_5': {
        'strategy': 'ai_meta_analysis',
        'min_improvement': 0.1,
        'timeout': 180
    }
}
```

## Summary

### What Changed

**From**:
- 2 regeneration attempts
- Auto-fallback to templates (5% usage)
- No human review

**To**:
- 5 regeneration attempts with escalating strategies
- Human review gate before templates
- Templates require approval (<0.001% usage)

### Template Usage Policy

✅ **Templates are kept** (emergency backup)
✅ **Templates are NOT created proactively** (waste of time)
✅ **Templates are NEVER auto-used** (human approval required)
✅ **Templates are RARELY needed** (<0.001% of time)

### Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Update regeneration loop (5 attempts, escalation)
2. **High Priority**: Add human review gate
3. **Medium Priority**: Add monitoring dashboard
4. **Low Priority**: Create additional templates (only if actually needed)

---

**This ensures templates exist for true emergencies (API outage, urgent news) but are essentially never used in normal operations (99.999% avoidance).**
