## üö® CRITICAL PRICING DECISIONS

### ‚ùå WHAT NOT TO DO

**1. Don't Start at ‚Çπ1,799 (Original Plan)**
- **Why:** Too high for entry tier in India
- Psychological barrier: Above ‚Çπ1,500 feels like "commitment"
- Market data: ChatGPT Go at ‚Çπ399, Plus at ‚Çπ1,999 validates ‚Çπ999-2,499 sweet spot

**2. Don't Offer "Free Forever" Plan**
- **Why:** Indian users will never convert from free to paid
- 73% adoption but low paid conversion = freemium doesn't work in India
- Exception: 14-day trial is fine (time-limited, not feature-limited)

**3. Don't Charge Per-Asset**

- Justifies 2.5x price jump (‚Çπ999 ‚Üí ‚Çπ2,499)
- Reels are trending (Instagram/YouTube shorts = highest engagement)
