# Context for New Terminal Session - JarvisDaily Landing Page Integration

## üéØ Current Situation

I'm working on **JarvisDaily** (jarvisdaily.com) - a SaaS platform that delivers Grammy-level viral WhatsApp content to financial advisors in India.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Live site deployed at jarvisdaily.com with black (#0A0A0A) & gold (#D4AF37) theme
- ‚úÖ v0.dev ZIP file ALREADY INTEGRATED - current jarvisdaily.com is built from v0.dev design
- ‚úÖ Old landing pages (landing-v1 through landing-v6) ALREADY DELETED
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive website analysis completed (screenshots in `/website-analysis/`)
- ‚úÖ "Grammy-Level" messaging reviewed and approved to keep
- ‚è≥ Need to add enhancement features: trial badges, social proof ticker, WhatsApp preview

## üìä Website Analysis Key Findings

**From Playwright analysis just completed:**

1. **Current Design:** Black & gold theme already deployed (NOT the purple version)
2. **Hero:** "Grammy-Level Viral WhatsApp Content for Financial Advisors" with 3D golden globe
3. **Pricing:** 3 tiers - Starter ‚Çπ1,799, Professional ‚Çπ4,499, Enterprise Custom
4. **Missing Critical Elements:**
   - 14-day free trial badges not prominent enough
   - Limited social proof (only 1 testimonial)
   - No WhatsApp message preview mockup

**"Grammy-Level" Verdict:** ‚úÖ KEEP IT - Works well for target audience, backed by actual 9.0/10 virality scoring

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

**Framework:** Next.js 15.5.4 with App Router
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI components
**Authentication:** Clerk (@clerk/nextjs v6.33.2)
**Deployment:** Vercel (auto-deploy via GitHub)
**Domain:** jarvisdaily.com

**Key Files:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Main landing page (currently live)
- `middleware.ts` - Clerk route protection
- `components/ui/*` - Shadcn components
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Custom gold color theme
- `.env` - All API credentials (Clerk, WhatsApp, Gemini, etc.)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project documentation with automation rules

**Files to Delete:**
- `app/landing-v1/` through `app/landing-v6/` - Failed design attempts, no longer needed

## üé® Design System

**Color Palette:**
- Primary Background: `#0A0A0A` (deep black)
- Primary Accent: `#D4AF37` (gold)
- Secondary Accent: `#FFD700` (bright gold)
- Text: `#FFFFFF` (white)
- Success/CTA: Green accent on Professional plan

**Typography:**
- Hero H1: Large, bold, gold color for "WhatsApp Content"
- Clean sans-serif throughout
- High contrast for readability on black

## üíº Business Logic Decisions (Already Made)

1. **Trial Period:** 14 days (industry standard)
2. **Payment Timing:** AFTER trial expires (not during signup)
3. **Signup Flow:** Minimal info ‚Üí Progressive profiling during onboarding
4. **Content Delivery:** Daily (1 asset/day for Solo, 3/day for Professional)
5. **Authentication:** Clerk with email/password + Google + LinkedIn OAuth
6. **Two CTA Buttons:** "Sign In" + "Start Free Trial"
7. **Pricing CTAs:** Lead to signup with plan pre-selected (no payment until trial ends)

## üîë Environment & Credentials

**All credentials available in `.env` file - Claude Code has automatic access. DO NOT ask user for:**
- Clerk keys (NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, CLERK_SECRET_KEY)

## üö® Critical Rules (From CLAUDE.md)

2. **File Management:** Avoid creating temp files in root - use proper directories
3. **Deployment:** Auto-commit and push after completing features (don't ask permission)
4. **Testing:** Run Playwright tests before deployment
5. **Grammy-Level Standard:** All content must score 9.0+/10 virality
