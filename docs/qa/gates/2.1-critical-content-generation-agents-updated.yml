notes: |
  Excellent security remediation by the Dev Agent. All critical vulnerabilities 
  have been systematically addressed with proper implementation:
  
  1. Command injection vulnerability completely eliminated
  2. No hardcoded secrets remain in the codebase
  3. Comprehensive validation ensures secure configuration
  4. Security tooling added for ongoing protection
  5. Clear documentation and templates provided
  
  The application is now production-ready from a security perspective.
  Remaining items are enhancements rather than vulnerabilities.
