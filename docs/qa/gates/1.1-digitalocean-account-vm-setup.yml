notes: |
  After scope analysis, determined that the problematic scripts were ad-hoc 
  troubleshooting tools created during setup, not required deliverables.
  
  Story successfully delivers:
  - Configured DigitalOcean account
  - Deployed Ubuntu 22.04 VM in BLR1
  - Proper security configuration (SSH, firewall, updates)
  - Monitoring and backup setup
  
  The infrastructure is ready for application deployment in subsequent stories.
