notes: |
  This is a CRITICAL FAIL due to exposed credentials in production code.
  The story cannot proceed to Done status despite functional success.
  
  The Dev Agent's claim in the story that "Successfully migrated 61 files 
  to use environment variables" is demonstrably false based on code inspection.
  
  While the WhatsApp integration functionality works as designed (templates,
  images, delivery), the security posture makes this completely unsuitable
  for production deployment.
  
  Excellent security infrastructure was created (env.config.js, validation,
  resilience) but was never actually integrated into the production codebase.
