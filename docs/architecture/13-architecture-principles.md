# 13. Architecture Principles

## 13.1 Design Principles
1. **Agent Autonomy:** Each agent is self-contained with single responsibility
2. **Eventual Consistency:** Tolerate temporary inconsistencies for performance
3. **Fail-Safe Operations:** System degrades gracefully, no complete failures
4. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Critical decisions have human oversight
5. **Progressive Enhancement:** Start simple, add complexity as needed

## 13.2 Operational Principles
1. **Observability First:** Every action is logged and measurable
2. **Automation with Override:** Automate everything but allow manual control
3. **Cost-Conscious Scaling:** Optimize for unit economics at every scale
4. **Security by Design:** Security considerations in every component
5. **Developer Experience:** Easy to understand, modify, and debug
