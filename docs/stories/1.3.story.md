- Basic directory structure exists in /home/mvp
- Claude Code authenticated with Max plan

### Webhook Server Specifications
[Source: architecture/4-integration-architecture.md#4.4]
```python
# Flask Webhook Server Structure
@app.route('/trigger', methods=['POST'])
def handle_trigger():
    """Receives real-time triggers from Google Apps Script"""
    payload = request.json
    action = payload.get('action')
    
    if action == 'revise':
        trigger_agent('revision-handler', payload)
    elif action == 'approve':
        update_approval_status(payload)
    
    return jsonify({'status': 'processed'}), 200

@app.route('/health', methods=['GET'])
def health_check():
    """Health endpoint for monitoring"""
    return jsonify({
        'status': 'healthy',
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
        'active_processes': get_active_processes()
    }), 200
```

### PM2 Configuration
[Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-architecture.md#5.2]
```javascript
// ecosystem.config.js
module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: 'webhook-server',
      script: 'webhook_server.py',
      interpreter: 'python3',
      instances: 1,
      autorestart: true,
      watch: false,
      max_memory_restart: '500M'
    },
    {
      name: 'claude-session',
      script: 'maintain_session.js',
      instances: 1,
      cron_restart: '0 0 * * *',  // Daily restart
      autorestart: true
    }
  ]
};
```

- Triggers: On form submission, On cell edit, Scheduled functions

### Security Considerations
- Webhook server should validate incoming requests
- Use environment variables for sensitive data (already set up in Story 1.2)
- Implement request rate limiting
- Log all incoming webhook requests for audit

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- `/home/mvp/scripts/webhook_server.py` - Main webhook server
- `/home/mvp/config/ecosystem.config.js` - PM2 configuration
- `/home/mvp/logs/webhook.log` - Webhook server logs
- `/home/mvp/scripts/maintain_session.js` - Claude session maintenance (placeholder)

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests not required for this infrastructure story
- Manual testing via curl commands for webhook endpoints
- PM2 status verification commands
- Google Apps Script test triggers

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation successfully delivers a working infrastructure for the FinAdvise MVP webhook system. The core components are functional with proper error handling, logging, and production hardening. However, there are critical security vulnerabilities and missing test coverage that need attention.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed as this is infrastructure setup code with placeholder implementations. The code structure is appropriate for this stage of development.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: N/A (standards document not found in project)
- Project Structure: ✓ Well-organized with scripts/, config/, logs/ directories
- Testing Strategy: ✗ No automated tests present, only manual testing documented
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 9 acceptance criteria have been implemented and verified

### Requirements Traceability

**Given-When-Then Mapping:**

1. **AC1: Project Structure**
   - Given: A fresh Ubuntu VM
   - When: Project directories are created
   - Then: /home/mvp contains scripts/, config/, logs/, data/, temp/ with proper permissions
   - Validation: Manual verification via SSH (documented in Dev Notes)

2. **AC2: Webhook Server Deployment**
   - Given: Flask webhook server implementation
   - When: Server is started via PM2
   - Then: Server responds on port 5001 (changed from 5000 due to conflict)
   - Validation: curl http://143.110.191.97:5001/health returns 200 OK

3. **AC3: PM2 Configuration**
   - Given: ecosystem.config.js with process definitions
   - When: PM2 loads the configuration
   - Then: webhook-server and claude-session processes are managed
   - Validation: pm2 status shows both processes running

4. **AC4: Health Monitoring**
   - Given: /health endpoint implementation
   - When: GET request is made
   - Then: Returns system status with active processes
   - Validation: Manual curl tests documented

5. **AC5: Webhook Triggers**
   - Given: /trigger endpoint with action handlers
   - When: POST request with action payload
   - Then: Appropriate handler is triggered
   - Validation: Test actions (generate, approve, revise) verified

6. **AC6: Google Sheets Setup**
   - Given: Google Sheets with required tabs
   - When: Sheets are created via script
   - Then: 5 tabs exist with proper schemas
   - Validation: Manual verification in Google Sheets

7. **AC7: Apps Script Configuration**
   - Given: Apps Script webhook functions
   - When: Menu actions are triggered
   - Then: Webhook requests are sent to VM
   - Validation: End-to-end test from Sheets to webhook

8. **AC8: Process Management**
   - Given: PM2 configuration with autorestart
   - When: Process crashes
   - Then: PM2 automatically restarts it
   - Validation: Kill process test verified auto-recovery

9. **AC9: Logging Configuration**
   - Given: Python logging setup
   - When: Events occur
   - Then: Logs are written with appropriate levels
   - Validation: Log files contain expected entries

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **CRITICAL: Remove hardcoded webhook secret** - Currently using 'default_secret_change_me' in production
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Implement proper authentication** - Webhook validation is minimal
- [ ] **HIGH: Add unit tests for webhook handlers** - No automated testing present
- [ ] **HIGH: Add integration tests for Google Sheets communication** - Only manual testing documented
- [ ] **MEDIUM: Implement rate limiting** - No protection against webhook spam
- [ ] **MEDIUM: Add request size limits** - No payload size validation
- [ ] **LOW: Add metrics collection** - No observability beyond basic logging
- [ ] **LOW: Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger** - Only basic inline documentation

### Security Review

**Critical Issues Found:**
1. **Hardcoded Secret**: WEBHOOK_SECRET uses default value 'default_secret_change_me' in production
2. **No HTTPS**: Webhook communication over HTTP (port 5001) exposes data in transit
3. **Weak Authentication**: Single shared secret with no rotation mechanism
4. **SSH Security**: PermitRootLogin and PasswordAuthentication enabled (emergency access but risky)
5. **No Input Sanitization**: Webhook payloads are not validated for injection attacks

**Recommendations:**
- Use environment variables for secrets with proper rotation
- Implement HTTPS with SSL certificates
- Add payload validation and sanitization
- Implement API rate limiting
- Consider OAuth2 or JWT for authentication

### Performance Considerations

1. **Process Management**: PM2 configuration is appropriate with memory limits (500M webhook, 200M session)
2. **Logging Performance**: File-based logging without rotation could fill disk
3. **Webhook Processing**: Synchronous processing could block under load
4. **No Caching**: Health checks query PM2 on every request

**Recommendations:**
- Implement log rotation (PM2 has this but needs configuration)
- Consider async processing for webhook handlers
- Cache health check results with short TTL
- Add connection pooling for future database connections

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Current State:**
- No automated unit tests
- No integration tests
- Manual testing only via curl commands and UI interactions
- No test data management strategy
- No continuous testing pipeline

**Required Test Coverage:**
1. **Unit Tests Needed:**
   - Webhook validation decorator
   - Trigger action routing
   - Error handling paths
   - Health check logic

2. **Integration Tests Needed:**
   - End-to-end webhook flow
   - Google Sheets API interaction
   - PM2 process management
   - SSH recovery mechanisms

3. **Performance Tests Needed:**
   - Webhook throughput under load
   - Memory usage over time
   - Recovery time after failure

### Files Modified During Review

None - Infrastructure code is functioning as designed for MVP phase.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.3-core-systems-setup.yml
Risk profile: High due to security vulnerabilities and lack of test coverage
NFR assessment: Security and reliability concerns identified

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]
Critical security issues must be addressed before production use. The webhook secret and authentication mechanism need immediate attention. Automated testing should be added to ensure reliability.
