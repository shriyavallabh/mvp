## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1 (Production Optimization):
- System successfully handles 50+ advisors
- WhatsApp delivery working with V2 engine
- PM2 already managing processes on VM
- Alert configuration exists in `/monitoring/alert-config.js`

### Story 3.2 Integration Context (CRITICAL FOR IMPLEMENTATION)
From Story 3.2 (Click-to-Unlock Strategy with Intelligent Webhook CRM) - **COMPLETED**:
- **Webhook Location**: VM port 3000 (https://6ecac5910ac8.ngrok-free.app/webhook)
- **Real-time Data Sources**: Button clicks, chat messages, content delivery events
- **Button Types**: RETRIEVE_CONTENT, UNLOCK_CONTENT, SHARE_WITH_CLIENTS
- **CRM Data**: Chat interactions, response times, conversation quality
- **Infrastructure**: PM2 process `webhook-button-handler`, ngrok tunnel active
- **API Integration Points**: /health endpoint exists, /metrics needed, WebSocket required
- **Data Schema**: Button events, chat messages, delivery status need persistent storage

### Architecture Context

#### Agent Hierarchy to Monitor
[Source: architecture/2-agent-architecture.md#2.1]
Real-time visualization of agent execution hierarchy:
```yaml
/content-engine (8:30 PM & 5:00 AM triggers)
├── content-orchestrator
│   ├── content-strategist (web scraping, topic selection)
│   ├── fatigue-checker (variation scoring)
│   ├── content-generator (Claude Opus content)
│   ├── image-creator (Gemini API visuals)
│   ├── compliance-validator (SEBI checks)
│   └── distribution-manager (WhatsApp delivery)
├── approval-guardian (11:00 PM auto-approval)
├── revision-handler (real-time edits)
└── analytics-tracker (metrics collection)
```

The dashboard will show:
- **Live Status**: Each agent's current state (idle, processing, completed, error)
- **Execution Timeline**: Visual timeline showing when each agent runs
- **Progress Indicators**: Real-time progress bars for long-running agents
- **Log Streaming**: Live logs from currently executing agents
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time, success rate, API calls made

#### Daily Workflow Visualization
At 8:30 PM, users can watch:
1. content-orchestrator starting and reading advisors
2. content-strategist scraping web for topics
3. fatigue-checker validating uniqueness
4. content-generator creating content (progress for each advisor)
5. image-creator generating visuals
6. compliance-validator checking each piece
7. Status updates as each advisor's content is prepared

#### Infrastructure Setup
[Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-architecture.md#5.1]
Dashboard will run on port 8080 as specified:
```yaml
firewall_rules:
  - port: 22 (SSH)
  - port: 3000 (Story 3.2 Webhook) # UPDATED FROM STORY 3.2
  - port: 8080 (Dashboard)  # Dashboard port already configured
```

#### Story 3.2 Dashboard Widgets (NEW - CRITICAL INTEGRATION)
Real-time monitoring widgets for Story 3.2 webhook system:
```javascript
// Webhook Status Widget
const webhookStatus = {
    status: 'healthy|down|error',
    uptime: '99.9%',
    lastHeartbeat: timestamp,
    tunnelUrl: 'https://6ecac5910ac8.ngrok-free.app/webhook',
    messagesProcessed: 1247
};

// Button Analytics Widget  
const buttonMetrics = {
    daily_button_clicks: {
        'RETRIEVE_CONTENT': 145,
        'UNLOCK_CONTENT': 89,
        'SHARE_WITH_CLIENTS': 203
    },
    click_response_time: '1.2s avg',
    success_rate: '98.7%',
    hourly_distribution: [...] // Chart data
};

// CRM Interaction Widget
const crmMetrics = {
    active_conversations: 12,
    chat_response_time: '2.4s avg',
    ai_response_quality: '4.2/5',
    daily_chat_volume: 67,
    conversation_completion_rate: '89%'
};
```

#### Process Management Integration
[Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-architecture.md#5.2]
PM2 ecosystem already configured, dashboard needs to integrate:
```javascript
// Existing PM2 apps to monitor
- webhook-button-handler (Node.js - Story 3.2) # NEW CRITICAL PROCESS
- claude-session (Node.js)
- Daily cron jobs for content generation
```

#### API Integration Specifications (NEW - STORY 3.2 INTEGRATION)
Dashboard must implement these API connections to Story 3.2:
```javascript
// Existing API endpoints in Story 3.2 webhook
GET https://6ecac5910ac8.ngrok-free.app/health
// Returns: { status: 'healthy', type: 'Button Click Handler', ... }

// NEW API endpoints needed in Story 3.2 webhook (Task 10)
GET /api/webhook/metrics
// Returns: button click counts, response times, success rates

GET /api/webhook/conversations  
// Returns: active chat sessions, response history

WebSocket /ws/events
// Stream: real-time button clicks, chat messages, status updates
```

#### Monitoring Requirements
[Source: architecture/1-architecture-overview.md#1.3 - monitoring component referenced]
Key metrics to track:
- Agent execution times
- API rate limit usage
- Content generation success rates
- WhatsApp delivery statistics
- System resource utilization

#### Data Sources
[Source: architecture/4-integration-architecture.md#4.1]
Dashboard will read from:
- Google Sheets (advisor data, content tracking)
  - Advisors tab: name, ARN, phone, status, created_at
  - Content tab: advisor_id, content, status, created_at, delivered_at
  - Analytics tab: metrics, counts, performance data
- PM2 API (process status)
- Local logs (/home/mvp/logs/)
- WhatsApp API (delivery status)
- System metrics (OS level)

### File Structure

```

### Security Considerations
- Basic authentication required (username/password)
  - Shared authentication system with Story 4.3 WhatsApp interface
  - Single sign-on between dashboard and WhatsApp interface
- Session management with secure cookies
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input validation for all forms
- HTTPS recommended for production (can use Cloudflare tunnel)

### Deployment Architecture
This monitoring dashboard serves as the main operations center and will host:
- Main dashboard at http://VM_IP:8080/
- WhatsApp interface (Story 4.3) at http://VM_IP:8080/whatsapp
- Shared authentication and session management
- Unified navigation between dashboard views

### PM2 Configuration Addition
```javascript
// Add to ecosystem.config.js
{
  name: 'monitoring-dashboard',
  script: '/monitoring/dashboard/server.js',
  instances: 1,
  autorestart: true,
  watch: false,
  env: {
    PORT: 8080,
    NODE_ENV: 'production'
  }
}
```
