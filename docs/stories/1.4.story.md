# Story 1.4: Content Engine Foundation - Core Agent Infrastructure

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to create the foundational agent infrastructure with the content-orchestrator parent agent and essential management agents,

6. Compliance-validator agent is implemented to check SEBI guidelines and ensure regulatory compliance
7. All agents follow the standardized communication protocol defined in architecture
8. Each agent can be triggered individually via Claude CLI for testing
9. Content-orchestrator can successfully coordinate execution of sub-agents in sequence
10. Error handling and retry logic is implemented for each agent

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates a solid foundation for the agent infrastructure with proper modular architecture. All 5 core agents (content-orchestrator, advisor-manager, content-strategist, fatigue-checker, compliance-validator) are successfully implemented with appropriate separation of concerns. The code follows Node.js best practices with proper async/await patterns and error handling. The agent communication protocol is well-structured using standardized message formats.
