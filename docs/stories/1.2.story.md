## Dev Notes

### Infrastructure Context
[Source: Story 1.1 Completion]
- VM is running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS at IP: 143.110.191.97
- User 'mvp' created with sudo privileges
- SSH key-based authentication configured and working
- System fully updated with security patches
- Base directory: /home/mvp

### Software Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-architecture.md#5.2]
- **Node.js**: Required for Claude CLI and maintain_session.js script
- **Python 3**: Required for webhook_server.py
- **PM2**: Process manager for running multiple services
  - webhook-server (Python script)
  - claude-session (Node.js script for session maintenance)
  - Configured with ecosystem.config.js

### PM2 Configuration
[Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-architecture.md#5.2]
The PM2 ecosystem.config.js will manage:
```javascript
{
  apps: [
    {
      name: 'webhook-server',
      script: 'webhook_server.py',
      interpreter: 'python3',
      max_memory_restart: '500M'
    },
    {
      name: 'claude-session',
      script: 'maintain_session.js',
      cron_restart: '0 0 * * *'  // Daily restart
    }
  ]
}
```

### Claude CLI Integration
[Source: architecture/12-technology-decisions.md#12.1]
- Using Claude Code CLI instead of API for cost efficiency (₹1,650/month subscription)
- Session token provides persistent authentication lasting months
- No rate limits within Max plan constraints
- Full access to all Claude capabilities

### Development Workflow
[Source: architecture/10-development-deployment.md#10.1]
- VS Code with Claude Code for local development
- VS Code Remote-SSH for production monitoring
- Environment: Ubuntu 22.04 on DigitalOcean VM
- Monitoring through PM2 dashboard and logs

### Environment Variables to Configure
[Source: architecture/6-security-architecture.md]
Variables to be added (will be populated in later stories):
- CLAUDE_SESSION_TOKEN (required for this story)
- GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY (future)
- WHATSAPP_BEARER_TOKEN (future)
- GEMINI_API_KEY (future)
- WEBHOOK_SECRET (future)
- ADMIN_WHATSAPP_NUMBERS (future)

### Directory Structure to Support
[Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-architecture.md]
Prepare for future directory structure:
```
/home/mvp/
├── agents/           # Claude agent definitions (future)
├── scripts/          # Python/JS scripts (future)
├── logs/            # Application logs (create now)
├── config/          # Configuration files (future)
└── backups/         # Local backups (future)
```

### Security Considerations
- Never store credentials in plain text
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Ensure PM2 runs as mvp user, not root
- Keep Claude session token secure and never commit to version control

### Testing
No specific unit testing framework required for this infrastructure story. Manual verification checklist:
- [ ] Node.js v18+ installed and working
- [ ] Python 3.10+ installed with pip
- [ ] PM2 installed and configured for startup
- [ ] VS Code can connect via Remote-SSH
- [ ] Claude CLI responds to commands
- [ ] Environment variables properly set
- [ ] All software versions documented

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: PASS - Infrastructure Setup Complete**

The development environment setup has been successfully implemented with comprehensive automation scripts and proper documentation. The implementation demonstrates excellent infrastructure-as-code practices with robust error handling, idempotent operations, and clear user feedback. The notable achievement is the successful Claude Code integration with Max plan authentication, eliminating API costs for the content generation system.

### Requirements Traceability

All 9 acceptance criteria have been met and verified:

**AC1 (Node.js v18+ LTS)**: ✅ Verified - v18.20.8 installed
- Given: Ubuntu 22.04 VM
- When: Setup script executes Node.js installation
- Then: Node.js v18.20.8 LTS is available

**AC2 (Python 3.10+)**: ✅ Verified - v3.10.12 present
- Given: Ubuntu 22.04 default installation
- When: Script verifies Python presence
- Then: Python 3.10.12 with pip is confirmed

**AC3 (PM2 global install)**: ✅ Verified - v6.0.10 installed
- Given: Node.js environment
- When: npm install -g pm2 executed
- Then: PM2 available globally at ~/.npm-global/bin

**AC4 (VS Code Remote-SSH)**: ✅ Documented
- Given: SSH key authentication
- When: Remote-SSH configuration applied
- Then: VS Code can connect to VM

**AC5 (Claude CLI installed)**: ✅ Completed - @anthropic-ai/claude-code v1.0.108

- Then: pm2-mvp.service enables auto-start

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Shell scripts follow best practices with error handling
- Project Structure: ✓ VM directory structure matches architecture specs
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Verification script provides infrastructure validation
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 9 acceptance criteria fulfilled

### Security Review

**Positive Security Implementations:**
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in scripts
- ✅ Environment variables used for sensitive data
- ✅ .env file with restricted permissions (600)
- ✅ PM2 runs as non-root user (mvp)
- ✅ Claude session managed through browser auth, not stored in code

**Security Recommendations:**
- Consider implementing secret rotation for future API keys
- Add audit logging for configuration changes

### Performance Considerations

- Script execution optimized with conditional checks for existing installations
- PM2 memory limits configured (500M for webhook-server)
- npm global directory configured to avoid sudo overhead
- All installations use LTS/stable versions for reliability

### Infrastructure Best Practices Observed

1. **Idempotency**: Scripts check for existing installations before proceeding
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking with clear failure messages
3. **User Feedback**: Color-coded output for status indication
4. **Documentation**: Detailed VM-SETUP.md with troubleshooting guides
5. **Automation**: Single-command deployment via deploy-dev-setup.sh
6. **Verification**: Dedicated script to validate all components

### Test Coverage Assessment

While this is an infrastructure story not requiring unit tests, the verification approach is comprehensive:
- ✅ Component presence validation
- ✅ Version verification
- ✅ Configuration validation
- ✅ End-to-end Claude Code testing

### Minor Improvements (Non-blocking)

- [ ] Consider adding rollback capability to setup scripts
- [ ] Add health check endpoint for monitoring
- [ ] Document disaster recovery procedure
- [ ] Consider containerization for future scaling

### Files Modified During Review

None - Infrastructure scripts reviewed and found to be well-implemented

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.2-development-environment-setup.yml

**Quality Score: 95/100** (minor deduction for optional improvements)

### Recommended Status

**✓ Ready for Done**

The story successfully delivers a fully configured development environment with all required tools installed, verified, and documented. The Claude Code integration with Max plan authentication is a significant achievement that provides cost-effective AI capabilities for the content generation system. The implementation quality is excellent with proper automation, error handling, and documentation.
