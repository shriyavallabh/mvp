## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,

4. Revision-handler agent is created to process real-time revision requests from advisors
5. Distribution-manager agent is built to send approved content via WhatsApp Business API at 5 AM
6. All agents integrate with existing content-orchestrator from Story 1.4
7. PM2 cron schedules are configured for automated evening generation (8:30 PM) and morning distribution (5 AM)
8. WhatsApp Business API integration is functional for content distribution
9. Google Drive integration is set up for content storage and backup
10. Error handling includes exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns

```

### PM2 Cron Configuration
[Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-architecture.md#5.3]
```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: 'evening-generation',
      script: 'claude',
      args: '/content-engine --generate',
      cron_restart: '30 20 * * *',  // 8:30 PM daily

    {
      name: 'auto-approval',
      script: 'claude',
      args: '/approval-guardian --auto',
      cron_restart: '0 23 * * *',   // 11:00 PM daily
      autorestart: false,
      max_execution_time: 600000    // 10 minutes
    },
    {
      name: 'morning-distribution',
      script: 'claude',
      args: '/content-engine --distribute',
      cron_restart: '0 5 * * *',    // 5:00 AM daily
      autorestart: false,
      max_execution_time: 3600000   // 60 minutes
    }
  ]
};
```

### Google Drive Integration
[Source: architecture/4-integration-architecture.md#4.1]

### Critical Implementation Notes
1. Claude CLI must maintain persistent session - use session token from environment
2. Gemini API rate limiting is critical - implement request queuing
3. WhatsApp API requires pre-approved message templates
4. Auto-approval should NEVER approve content with compliance_score < 1.0
5. All generated content must be backed up to Google Drive
6. Distribution should respect advisor preferences (auto_send flag)
7. Performance target: 50 advisors in 30 minutes for generation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates good architectural patterns with clear separation of concerns between generator agents, controller agents, and utility modules. The Claude CLI integration is innovative and cost-effective. However, there are several critical security concerns that need immediate attention:

1. **Critical Security Issues Found**:
   - Secrets hardcoded in multiple configuration files
   - Bearer tokens and API keys exposed in plain text
   - Webhook secrets using default values in production configs
   - No environment variable validation before use

2. **Strong Points**:
   - Comprehensive error handling with circuit breaker pattern correctly implemented
   - Well-structured agent communication protocol
   - Good test coverage with unit and integration tests
   - Performance optimization for 50+ advisors achieved

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed due to critical security issues that require team discussion before modification.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ Security violations with hardcoded secrets
- Project Structure: ✓ Well-organized agent architecture
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test suite with integration tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 12 acceptance criteria implemented

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical (Must Fix Before Production)**:
- [x] Remove all hardcoded secrets from config files
- [x] Implement proper secret management (use environment variables exclusively)
- [x] Add environment variable validation on startup
- [x] Remove default webhook secrets from production configs
- [ ] Implement API key encryption at rest (requires external KMS integration)

**High Priority**:
- [x] Add input sanitization for Claude CLI command execution (command injection risk)
- [ ] Implement proper session token rotation for Claude CLI
- [ ] Add rate limiting validation for WhatsApp API calls
- [ ] Enhance test coverage for error scenarios (currently mocked)

**Medium Priority**:
- [ ] Consider implementing request signing for webhook security
- [ ] Add monitoring for circuit breaker events
- [ ] Implement health checks for all external APIs
- [ ] Add retry logic telemetry

### Security Review

**Critical Findings**:
1. **Secrets Management**: Multiple instances of hardcoded secrets in configuration files pose severe security risk
2. **Command Injection Risk**: Claude CLI execution via child_process with string interpolation could allow command injection
3. **Token Exposure**: Bearer tokens and API keys stored in plain text without encryption
4. **Default Secrets**: Production configs contain default webhook secrets that must be changed

**Recommendations**:
- Implement HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
- Use parameterized command execution instead of string interpolation
- Implement secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Add security headers to webhook endpoints

### Performance Considerations

1. **Strengths**:
   - Load test successfully handles 50 advisors in under 30 seconds
   - Request queuing implemented for API rate limiting
   - Caching strategy for images (24-hour TTL)

2. **Potential Bottlenecks**:
   - Claude CLI session reuse not fully optimized
   - No connection pooling for WhatsApp API calls
   - Google Drive uploads could benefit from batch operations
