# ✅ Add Test Recipients - Works Like Production for 4 Advisors!

## 🎉 GOOD NEWS: You Don't Need to Publish!

**For 4 advisors, "Test Recipients" mode works perfectly** - they receive real messages with no limits.

## 📱 HOW TO ADD TEST RECIPIENTS (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Go to WhatsApp Test Numbers

**Direct Link:**
```
https://developers.facebook.com/apps/100088701756168/whatsapp-business/wa-dev-console/
```

**Or Navigate:**
1. Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/100088701756168
2. Click "WhatsApp" in left sidebar
3. Click "API Setup" or "Getting Started"
4. Scroll to find "Send and receive messages" section

---

### Step 2: Add Your 4 Advisor Numbers

Look for a field that says **"To:"** or **"Recipient phone number"** or **"Test numbers"**

**Add these numbers (one at a time):**

```
919673758777    (Shruti)
918975758513    (Vidyadhar)
919765071249    (Shriya)
919022810769    (Tranquil Veda)
```

**Format:** Country code + number, NO spaces, NO + sign

### Step 3: Verify Numbers (if prompted)

Meta might ask each number to verify via WhatsApp:
1. They'll receive a verification message
2. They reply with the code
3. Number is now approved as "test recipient"
