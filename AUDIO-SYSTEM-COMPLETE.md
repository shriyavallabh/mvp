# Audio System Implementation - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## What Was Built

### 1. Audio Configuration System
**File**: `orchestration/hooks/audio-config.json`

```json
{
  "enabled": true,  // Master on/off switch
  "voice": {
    "type": "female",
    "engine": "say",
    "voice_name": "Samantha",
    "rate": 200,      // Words per minute
    "volume": 0.8     // 80% volume
  },
  "agents": {
    // 17 agent announcements configured
    "market-intelligence": {
      "start": "Market Intelligence is gathering latest market data",
      "complete": "Market Intelligence has completed market analysis"
    },
    // ... (all other agents)
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Audio Control Script
**File**: `orchestration/hooks/audio-control.sh`

```bash
# Turn audio ON
./orchestration/hooks/audio-control.sh on

# Turn audio OFF
./orchestration/hooks/audio-control.sh off

# Check status
./orchestration/hooks/audio-control.sh status

# Test audio
./orchestration/hooks/audio-control.sh test
```

**What it does**:
- Modifies `audio-config.json` ‚Üí `"enabled": true/false`
- Updates `hooks.yaml` audio settings
- Plays test announcement to verify

---

### 3. Audio Announcer Engine
**File**: `orchestration/hooks/agent-audio-announcer.js`

**Core functionality**:
- Reads audio-config.json
- Loads agent-specific announcements
- Uses macOS `say` command with Samantha voice
- Can be called with: `node agent-audio-announcer.js start market-intelligence`

---

### 4. Universal Hook Script
**File**: `orchestration/hooks/universal-agent-hook.sh`

**Purpose**: Wrapper that hooks can call
```bash
bash orchestration/hooks/universal-agent-hook.sh market-intelligence start
```

---

### 5. Test Script
**File**: `orchestration/hooks/test-agent-audio.sh`

**Purpose**: Test all agent announcements manually
```bash
./orchestration/hooks/test-agent-audio.sh
```

Simulates 8 agents with start/complete announcements.

---

### 6. Updated `/o` Command
**File**: `.claude/commands/o.md`

**Key changes**:
- ‚úÖ Added audio control section at top
- ‚úÖ Documented audio announcements for each agent
- ‚úÖ Explained how to enable/disable audio
- ‚úÖ Shows exact announcements that will play

**Example execution plan**:
```
Phase 1: Data Loading
- Task(advisor-data-manager)
  üîä "Advisor Data Manager is loading advisor information"
  [Agent executes]
  üîä "Advisor Data Manager has loaded all advisor profiles"
```

---

## How It Works

### Integration Flow

```
User runs: /o
    ‚Üì
Claude reads: .claude/commands/o.md (updated with audio instructions)
    ‚Üì
Before each Task call:
    ‚îú‚îÄ Check: orchestration/hooks/audio-config.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ If enabled: node agent-audio-announcer.js start <agent>
    ‚îú‚îÄ Execute: Task(agent-name)
    ‚îú‚îÄ If enabled: node agent-audio-announcer.js complete <agent>
    ‚îî‚îÄ Continue to next agent
```

### Audio Trigger Points

**When I execute `/o`, I will**:

1. **Before each agent**:
   ```bash
   node orchestration/hooks/agent-audio-announcer.js start advisor-data-manager
   ```
   üîä Plays: "Advisor Data Manager is loading advisor information"

2. **Execute agent**:
   ```javascript
   await Task({
     subagent_type: "advisor-data-manager",
     prompt: "Load advisors from data/advisors.json..."
   })
   ```

3. **After agent completes**:
   ```bash
   node orchestration/hooks/agent-audio-announcer.js complete advisor-data-manager
   ```
   üîä Plays: "Advisor Data Manager has loaded all advisor profiles"

## Quick Start Guide

### First Time Setup

1. **Test audio works**:
   ```bash
   ./orchestration/hooks/audio-control.sh test
   ```
   You should hear: "Testing FinAdvise audio announcement system..."

2. **Enable audio** (if not already enabled):
   ```bash
   ./orchestration/hooks/audio-control.sh on
   ```

3. **Run `/o` command**:
   ```
   /o
   ```
   You'll now hear announcements for all 14 agents!

---

### Daily Usage

**Audio Enabled** (default):
```bash
/o  # Runs with audio announcements
```

**Disable for This Session**:
```bash
./orchestration/hooks/audio-control.sh off
/o  # Runs silently
```

**Re-enable**:
```bash
./orchestration/hooks/audio-control.sh on
/o  # Audio is back
```

---

## Customization

### Change Voice
Edit `orchestration/hooks/audio-config.json`:
```json
{
  "voice": {
    "voice_name": "Samantha",  // Or: Victoria, Karen, Moira
    "rate": 200,               // 150-250 recommended
    "volume": 0.8              // 0.0-1.0
  }
}
```

**Available macOS voices**:
- **Samantha** (US English) - Professional, clear ‚úÖ Default
- **Victoria** (US English) - Warm, friendly
- **Karen** (Australian) - Clear, energetic
- **Moira** (Irish) - Distinctive

Test voices: `say -v Victoria "Testing voice"`

### Adjust Speed
- Slower: `"rate": 175` (more deliberate)
- Normal: `"rate": 200` (current)
- Faster: `"rate": 225` (quicker)

### Adjust Volume
- Quieter: `"volume": 0.5`
- Normal: `"volume": 0.8` (current)
- Louder: `"volume": 1.0`

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Audio Playing

1. **Check audio is enabled**:
   ```bash
   ./orchestration/hooks/audio-control.sh status
   ```
   Should show: "‚úì audio-config.json: ENABLED"

2. **Test system audio**:
   ```bash
   say "test"
   ```
   If this doesn't work, macOS audio is the issue, not our system.

3. **Verify config file**:
   ```bash
   cat orchestration/hooks/audio-config.json | grep enabled
   ```
   Should show: `"enabled": true`

---

### Audio Too Fast/Slow

Edit rate in `orchestration/hooks/audio-config.json`:
```json
"rate": 175  // Slower (was 200)
```

Then test:
```bash
./orchestration/hooks/audio-control.sh test
```

---

### Wrong Voice

List available voices:
```bash
say -v ?
```

Update in `audio-config.json`:
```json
"voice_name": "Victoria"  // Change from Samantha
```
