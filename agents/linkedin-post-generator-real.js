Everyone said "Market will recover."
It did. But I had already sold at loss.

Today at Sensex ${sensex}, I see the same fear in clients' eyes.

Here's what 2008 taught me that nobody talks about:

1. The market crashed 60%
   ‚Üí But SIP investors made 127% returns by 2010

2. Panicked sellers lost ‚Çπ4.6 lakh crores
   ‚Üí Patient investors gained ‚Çπ12 lakh crores

3. IT stocks everyone hated at ‚Çπ200
   ‚Üí Trading at ‚Çπ1,800 today

The brutal truth?

Your emotions are your portfolio's biggest enemy.
Not the market. Not inflation. Not even bad stocks.

When IT is up ${itPerformance} today, everyone's buying.
But real wealth? It's made when everyone's selling.

My ‚Çπ15 lakh loss became my ‚Çπ2 crore lesson.

What's yours?

P.S. Still have the screenshot of that loss.
Keeps me humble. And rich.

I met Raju in 2012. Monthly income: ‚Çπ8,000.
"Saheb, can I also invest?"

Everyone laughed. I didn't.

Started his SIP: ‚Çπ500.
Increased to ‚Çπ1,000 in 2014.
Then ‚Çπ2,000 in 2016.
Now: ‚Çπ5,000 monthly.

12 years later:
‚Ä¢ Invested: ‚Çπ3.6 lakhs
‚Ä¢ Current value: ‚Çπ47 lakhs
‚Ä¢ His daughter: Studying engineering

The elite will tell you "need ‚Çπ1 lakh to start."

Raju proved them wrong.

Your excuse is what exactly?

With Sensex at ${sensex} and ${topGainer} leading IT gains at ${itPerformance}, opportunities are everywhere.

Start today. Start small. But START.

Here's why I'm telling my clients the OPPOSITE of what everyone else is saying.

Data from last 20 years:

When Sensex crossed 80,000:
‚Üí 73% investors bought heavily
‚Üí 89% regretted it within 6 months

When Sensex was at 50,000 (COVID crash):
‚Üí Only 8% had courage to buy
‚Üí They made 65% returns in 2 years

Today's reality:
‚Ä¢ IT sector: ${itPerformance} (everyone's euphoric)
‚Ä¢ FII inflow: Record high (greed indicator)
‚Ä¢ P/E ratios: Above historical average

What I'm doing differently:

1. NOT stopping SIPs (discipline > timing)
2. Booking partial profits in overheated sectors
3. Building cash for the next correction
4. Increasing allocation to undervalued sectors

Contrarian thinking made Warren Buffett $100 billion.
Following the crowd made people broke.

Which side are you on?
