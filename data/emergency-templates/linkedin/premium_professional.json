Portfolio value: ₹47 lakhs.\n\nHere's what I told him:\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nPanic selling in volatile markets is how wealth gets destroyed.\n\nNot by market corrections.\nBy emotional decisions.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nWhat we did instead:\n\n1. Reviewed his 10-year goals (unchanged)\n2. Analyzed asset allocation (still optimal)\n3. Identified tax-loss harvesting opportunities\n4. Rebalanced to target ratios\n\nResult: Portfolio stronger. Emotions calmer. Strategy intact.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nFor HNI portfolios (₹50L+):\n\n✓ Volatility is opportunity (not risk)\n✓ Rebalancing > Panic selling\n✓ Tax efficiency > Emotional comfort\n✓ Strategy > Market timing\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nYour wealth isn't built in bull markets.\n\nIt's protected in corrections.\n\n[TAGLINE]\n[ARN_NUMBER]\n\n#WealthManagement #HNIInvesting #PortfolioStrategy #MarketVolatility\n\nMutual fund investments are subject to market risks.
