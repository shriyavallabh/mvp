# üö® IMMEDIATE WEBHOOK FIX - DO THIS NOW

## The Problem in Your Screenshot
You have **"Test number: +1 555 018 8463"** selected in the dropdown. This is WRONG!

## Step-by-Step Fix (Do This Right Now)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Change the Dropdown Selection

In the "From" dropdown where you see "Test number: +1 555 018 8463":

1. **DO NOT** select any of these:
   - ‚ùå Test Number (+1 555 018 8463)
   - ‚ùå The Skin Rules (+91 90224 73943)
   - ‚ùå Your Jarvis Daily Assistant (+91 76666 84471)

2. **INSTEAD**, look for an option that says:
   - ‚úÖ **"WhatsApp Business Account"** or
   - ‚úÖ **"Your WABA Name"** (without any phone number)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ If You Don't See WABA Option

If the dropdown only shows phone numbers:

1. **Go back** to the main WhatsApp Manager
2. Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Configuration** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
3. Make sure you're at the ACCOUNT level, not phone number level
4. The URL should be something like:
   ```
   business.facebook.com/.../whatsapp-business/wa-manager/settings/webhooks
   ```
   NOT:
   ```
   business.facebook.com/.../phone-numbers/[ID]/settings
   ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Correct Configuration Location

You should be configuring webhooks here:

**WhatsApp Manager** ‚Üí **Settings** (at account level) ‚Üí **Webhooks**

NOT here:

**WhatsApp Manager** ‚Üí **Phone Numbers** ‚Üí [Select a phone] ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Webhooks**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Once You're in the Right Place

1. **Product Selection**: Choose **"WhatsApp Business Account"** (NOT "Application")
2. **Callback URL**: `https://softball-one-realtor-telecom.trycloudflare.com/webhook`
3. **Verify Token**: `jarvish_webhook_2024`
4. **mTLS**: Keep "Attach a client certificate" **OFF** (unchecked)
5. Click **Verify and Save**

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Subscribe to Fields

After saving, you MUST see a list of fields. Make sure these show **"Unsubscribe"** (meaning they're subscribed):
- **messages** - CRITICAL! Must show "Unsubscribe"
- **message_status** - Should show "Unsubscribe"
- **message_template_status_update** - Should show "Unsubscribe"

If any show "Subscribe", click it to subscribe!

## üéØ Quick Check

You're in the RIGHT place if:
- The page title mentions "WhatsApp Business Account Settings"
- There's NO phone number in the dropdown selection
- You see ALL your phone numbers affected by this webhook

You're in the WRONG place if:
- A specific phone number is selected in the dropdown
- The page mentions a specific phone number's settings
- You only see settings for one phone number

## After Fixing

Once configured correctly:
1. Send a new test message with button
2. Click the button
3. Watch logs: `tail -f webhook.log`
4. You should see "BUTTON CLICK DETECTED!"

## The Rule

**NEVER configure webhooks at phone number level!**
**ALWAYS configure at WhatsApp Business Account level!**

Phone-level webhooks OVERRIDE account-level webhooks, which is why your button clicks aren't working!
