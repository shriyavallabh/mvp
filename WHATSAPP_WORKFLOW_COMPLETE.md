## 🔄 Image Template Workflow (For Future)

The resumable upload API requires specific App permissions. For now:
1. Use text-only templates (working perfectly)
2. Images can be added through Meta Business Suite UI
3. Or wait for proper App permissions for programmatic upload

## 💡 Important Notes
- Templates auto-approve faster with UTILITY category
- No need for advisors to say "hi" first - templates work immediately
- Messages are being delivered to all three advisors successfully
- All delivery reports saved in JSON format for tracking
