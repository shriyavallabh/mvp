# üîß META WEBHOOK CONFIGURATION FIX GUIDE

## The Problem
Your WhatsApp phone number has its own webhook configuration that OVERRIDES the WhatsApp Business Account webhook. This is why button clicks aren't reaching your server.

## Step-by-Step Fix in Meta Business Manager

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Remove Phone Number Level Webhook

1. Go to: https://business.facebook.com
2. Navigate to: **WhatsApp Manager**
3. Select your **Phone Number** (574744175733556)
4. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Configuration**
5. Look for **"Phone number webhook"** section
6. If there's a webhook URL configured here, **REMOVE IT**
7. Click **Save**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure ONLY at WhatsApp Business Account Level

1. Go to: **WhatsApp Manager** ‚Üí **Settings**
2. Click **Webhooks** (at ACCOUNT level, not phone number)
3. Click **Edit**
4. Enter:
   - Callback URL: `https://softball-one-realtor-telecom.trycloudflare.com/webhook`
   - Verify Token: `jarvish_webhook_2024`
5. Click **Verify and Save**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Subscribe to Correct Fields

1. After webhook is verified, you'll see field subscriptions
2. Make sure these are CHECKED:
   - ‚úÖ **messages** (CRITICAL for button clicks)
   - ‚úÖ **message_status** 
   - ‚úÖ **message_template_status_update**
3. Click **Done**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify No Conflicting Webhooks

Check these locations and REMOVE any webhooks:
- ‚ùå Phone Number Settings ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Webhook
- ‚ùå Application Product ‚Üí Webhooks
- ‚úÖ WhatsApp Business Account ‚Üí Webhooks (ONLY keep this one)

## Why This Happens

Meta has a webhook hierarchy:
```
Phone Number Webhook (Priority 1) 
    ‚Üì overrides
WABA Webhook (Priority 2)
    ‚Üì overrides  
App Webhook (Priority 3)
```

If you have a Phone Number webhook, it receives ALL events and your WABA webhook gets nothing!

## Testing After Fix

1. Send a new interactive message with button
2. Click the button
3. Check webhook logs: `tail -f webhook.log`
4. You should see: "WEBHOOK EVENT RECEIVED!"

## Marketing Template Issues

Marketing templates being filtered is a SEPARATE issue:
- Marketing templates have delivery caps in India
- They get filtered even if approved
- Solution: Use UTILITY templates for guaranteed delivery

## Webhook Products Explained

| Product | Purpose | Configure For Button Clicks? |
|---------|---------|------------------------------|
| **WhatsApp Business Account** | All WhatsApp events | ‚úÖ YES - ONLY THIS ONE |
| **Application** | App-level events | ‚ùå NO |
| **Page** | Facebook Page events | ‚ùå NO |
| **Instagram** | Instagram DMs | ‚ùå NO |
| **User** | User permissions | ‚ùå NO |

## Common Mistakes

1. ‚ùå Configuring webhook at Phone Number level
2. ‚ùå Configuring multiple webhook products
3. ‚ùå Not subscribing to "messages" field
4. ‚ùå Using Application product for WhatsApp

## Correct Configuration

‚úÖ ONLY configure webhook at WhatsApp Business Account level
‚úÖ ONLY subscribe to "messages" field (minimum)
‚úÖ Remove ALL other webhook configurations

After following these steps, button clicks will work immediately!
