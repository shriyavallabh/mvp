description: Fixed orchestration - executes 14 individual agents with proper management

# Fixed /o Command Implementation

When you run `/o`, execute these 14 agents INDIVIDUALLY using Task tool:

## Execution Order with Dependencies

### Phase 1 - Data Collection (Parallel)
```
Task 1: advisor-data-manager
Task 2: market-intelligence
```

### Phase 2 - Analysis (Depends on Phase 1)
```
Task 3: segment-analyzer (needs advisor data)
```

### Phase 3 - Content Generation (Parallel, needs Phase 1 & 2)
```
Task 4: linkedin-post-generator
Task 5: whatsapp-message-creator
Task 6: status-image-designer
```

### Phase 4 - Enhancement (Needs Phase 3)
```
Task 7: gemini-image-generator (needs designs)
Task 8: brand-customizer (needs all content)
```

### Phase 5 - Validation (Needs Phase 3)
```
Task 9: compliance-validator
Task 10: quality-scorer
Task 11: fatigue-checker
```

### Phase 6 - Distribution (Needs Phase 5)
```
Task 12: distribution-controller
```

### Phase 7 - Analytics (Needs Phase 6)
```
Task 13: analytics-tracker
Task 14: feedback-processor
```

## Required Implementation Elements

### 1. Session Management
- Create session_id with timestamp
- Save session state to output/session_id/session_state.json
- Track which agents completed

### 2. Memory Management
- Update data/shared-context.json after each agent
- Pass previous agent outputs to dependent agents
- Maintain agent_outputs dictionary

### 3. Communication Bus
- Save messages to output/session_id/communication_log.json
- Include last 5 messages in each agent's context
- Broadcast completion events

### 4. Learning Extraction
- Run scripts/extract-learnings.py after completion
- Create learnings/learning_session_id.md
- Track failures and improvements

## Python Script Alternative
```bash
python3 orchestrate-finadvise.py
```

## What's Still Missing (Honest Assessment)

### ❌ MCP Integration
- Not implemented in Claude Code yet
- Would require MCP server setup
- Currently using Task tool as alternative

### ❌ True Bidirectional Communication
- Agents can't talk back to orchestrator
- No real-time message passing
- Sequential execution only

### ❌ Real Agent Memory
- No persistent memory between sessions
- Each agent starts fresh
- Context passed manually

### ⚠️ Partial Implementations
- Session management: Basic file-based
- Communication: One-way broadcasting
- Learning: Post-session extraction only

## To Make /o Work Properly

The `/o` command needs to:
1. Execute 14 separate Task tool calls (not one master)
2. Pass context between agents
3. Save outputs to session directories
4. Extract learnings after completion

Currently, `/o` just shows this description and doesn't execute anything!
