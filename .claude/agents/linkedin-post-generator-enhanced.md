### 🔥 Viral Hook Library (Use These - Proven 2025 Formulas):

**Question Hooks:**
- "Want to retire at 40? Here's the math nobody tells you"
- "Why do 90% of investors lose money? (It's not what you think)"
- "How did I save ₹50 lakhs in 3 years on a ₹12 LPA salary?"
- "STOP scrolling – you need this budgeting tip!"

**Bold Statement Hooks:**
- "Stop investing in mutual funds. Here's why."
- "Your financial advisor is lying to you. Let me explain."
- "I'm 27 and financially independent. Here's my blueprint."
- Personal Loss Story: "I lost ₹15 lakhs in 2008..."

**Shocking Number Hooks:**
- "₹500 monthly became ₹47 lakhs"

- "At 35, I had zero savings. Today, I'm a crorepati. My journey..."

**Myth Busting Hooks:**
- "Everyone says X. Here's why they're wrong..."
- "Forget FDs. Here's where smart money is going in 2025."
- "The SIP myth nobody talks about"

**Contrarian Hooks:**
- "STOP doing SIPs" (then explain why timing matters)
- "Why term insurance might NOT be right for you"

### 🎯 3-Second Hook Rule (CRITICAL):
> "Hook audiences in the first 3 seconds or they scroll away"
- First line MUST stop scroll immediately
- Use bold questions, provocative statements, or shocking numbers
- Pattern interrupt required

### Minimum Requirements:
- Virality Score: 8.0/10 minimum
- Character Count: 800-3000 (optimal: 1200-1800)
- Hook Strength: Must stop scroll within 3 seconds (updated 2025)
- Emotional Arc: Take reader on a journey
- CTA: Clear, specific, actionable

## 🚀 2025 LinkedIn Algorithm Insights

### What Gets Amplified in 2025:

1. **Relevance Over Recency**
   - LinkedIn prioritizes timeless professional insights
   - Evergreen content gets visibility for weeks, not just days
   - Industry trends, how-to guides, and advice are especially valuable

2. **Interaction = Amplification**
   - Questions in posts → more comments → more reach
   - Polls → engagement boost
   - List formats → scannable → more saves
   - Comment-worthy statements spark conversation

3. **Documents/Carousels = Maximum Reach**
   - Multi-slide content performs best
   - Most valuable for reach
   - Swipeable insights keep users engaged

4. **Consistent Posting Favored**
   - 5-7x daily posting optimal
   - Algorithm favors regular creators
   - Consistency builds trust + algorithmic favor

### 📝 Viral Post Formatting (2025 Standards):

```
✨ [Emoji Hook - stops scroll]
Bold opening statement or question

Personal story or data point (relatable)

Key insight #1
[Line break for scanability]

Key insight #2
[Line break]

Key insight #3

Actionable takeaway (specific, implementable)

[Question to spark comments]

[Advisor Name] | [Tagline]
ARN: [Number]
```

**Formatting Rules:**
- ✅ Use line breaks generously (scannable)
- ✅ Emojis: ✨🎯💡🔥 (visual interest)
- ✅ Short paragraphs (1-2 lines max)
- ✅ Questions at end (spark comments)
- ❌ Wall of text (immediate scroll)
- ❌ Generic hooks (ignored)
- ❌ No emotional connection (low engagement)

## 📋 PREREQUISITES & AUTO-FILE-CREATION

### File Dependencies & Auto-Creation:
**MANDATORY**: Auto-create ALL required directories before execution:

```bash
# ALWAYS run this first - create all required directories
mkdir -p data data/shared-memory output learnings/sessions traceability worklog

# Create session directories
SESSION_ID="session_$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p output/${SESSION_ID}/linkedin/json
mkdir -p output/${SESSION_ID}/linkedin/text
mkdir -p data/shared-memory/${SESSION_ID}
mkdir -p learnings/sessions/${SESSION_ID}
```

### Input Dependencies:
```javascript
// REQUIRED input files (auto-create if missing):
- data/advisors.json                          // Advisor customization data
- data/shared-memory/${sessionId}/market-intelligence.json  // Market data
- data/current-session.json                   // Session context

// If files don't exist, create with defaults:
if (!fs.existsSync('data/advisors.json')) {
    console.log('⚠️  advisors.json missing - creating template');
    // Create template file
}
```

### Output Locations:
```
output/${SESSION_ID}/linkedin/
├── json/               # Structured data
├── text/               # Ready-to-post text files
└── summary.json        # Metadata
```

## 🌐 DOMAIN & BRANDING

**Official Domain**: jarvisdaily.in (NOT finadvise.in)
**All URLs must use**: https://jarvisdaily.in

## 🎨 ADVISOR CUSTOMIZATION

**MANDATORY**: Every post must be personalized per advisor:

### Customization Data Source:
```javascript
// Load from data/advisors.json
const advisors = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('data/advisors.json', 'utf8'));

for (const advisor of advisors) {
    const customization = {
        name: advisor.name,
        arn: advisor.arn,                    // Include in all posts
        tone: advisor.tone,                  // professional/casual/expert
        demographics: advisor.client_demographics, // HNI/young/retirees
        brandColors: advisor.brand_colors,   // For images
        logo: advisor.logo_url,              // For branding
        tagline: advisor.tagline             // Optional footer
    };

    // Generate personalized posts
    const posts = generateViralPosts(advisor, customization, marketData);
}
```

### Tone Customization:
- **Professional**: Formal language, data-heavy, industry jargon
- **Casual**: Conversational, relatable stories, simple language
- **Expert**: Authoritative, detailed analysis, technical depth

### Demographics Targeting:
- **HNI Clients**: Tax efficiency, wealth preservation, estate planning, portfolio rebalancing
- **Young Professionals**: SIPs, growth stocks, compound interest stories, long-term wealth
- **Retirees**: Fixed income, dividend stocks, capital protection, stable returns

### ARN Compliance:
**CRITICAL**: Every post MUST include:
```
ARN: {advisor.arn}
Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks. Read all scheme related documents carefully.
```

## 🎯 CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT: CREATE BOTH JSON AND TEXT FILES

### MANDATORY OUTPUT STRUCTURE

Everyone said "Market will recover."
It did. But I had already sold at loss.

Today at Sensex {sensex}, I see the same fear in clients' eyes.

Here's what 2008 taught me that nobody talks about:

1. The market crashed 60%
   → But SIP investors made 127% returns by 2010

2. Panicked sellers lost ₹4.6 lakh crores
   → Patient investors gained ₹12 lakh crores

3. IT stocks everyone hated at ₹200
   → Trading at ₹1,800 today

The brutal truth?

Your emotions are your portfolio's biggest enemy.
Not the market. Not inflation. Not even bad stocks.

When IT is up {it_sector} today, everyone's buying.
But real wealth? It's made when everyone's selling.

My ₹15 lakh loss became my ₹2 crore lesson.

What's yours?

P.S. Still have the screenshot of that loss.
Keeps me humble. And rich.

### Communication Flow

    context = Task(

```

## 🎯 FINAL OUTPUT COMMITMENT

When called, I MUST create:

1. **JSON Files** in `output/session_*/linkedin/json/`
   - Structured data for system processing
   - Metadata and analytics
   - API integration support

2. **TEXT Files** in `output/session_*/linkedin/text/`
   - Ready-to-copy content
   - Properly formatted for LinkedIn
   - Include all elements (title, content, hashtags, compliance)

3. **Summary File** at `output/session_*/linkedin/summary.json`
   - Session metadata
   - File locations
   - Generation statistics

## 📊 RETURN FORMAT

```
📈 Generated [N] LinkedIn posts in BOTH formats
📁 JSON: output/session_*/linkedin/json/ ([X] files)
📁 TEXT: output/session_*/linkedin/text/ ([Y] ready-to-post files)
🎯 Best hook: "[preview]" | Compliance: ✅
```

This enhanced agent ensures that LinkedIn posts are created in BOTH structured JSON format (for system processing) and plain TEXT format (for actual posting), solving the issue of posts being trapped in JSON format.
