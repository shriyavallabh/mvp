# ‚è∏Ô∏è Implementation Checkpoint #1 - Supabase Schema Ready

**Time**: ~15 minutes into implementation
**Progress**: 5/34 tasks complete (15%)

---

## ‚úÖ Completed

1. ‚úÖ Architecture analysis
2. ‚úÖ Research (OAuth best practices, Redis caching patterns)
3. ‚úÖ Documentation (AUTHENTICATION-REBUILD-ARCHITECTURE.md)
4. ‚úÖ Supabase schema file created (`supabase-schema.sql`)

---

## üéØ CRITICAL: Run Supabase Schema NOW

**‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKING: You must run this SQL before I can continue**

### Steps:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select project: `jqvyrtoohlwiivsronzo`
3. Click: SQL Editor (left sidebar)
4. Click: "New Query"
5. Copy entire contents of `/Users/shriyavallabh/Desktop/mvp/supabase-schema.sql`
6. Paste into SQL editor
7. Click: "Run" (or press Cmd+Enter)
8. Verify success: You should see "Success. No rows returned"

### Verification:
Run this query to confirm tables exist:
```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name IN ('users', 'advisor_profiles');
```

**Expected result**: 2 rows showing both tables

## üì¶ Next Up (After Supabase)

I'll continue with:
1. Install dependencies (`@vercel/kv`, `googleapis`)
2. Create utility libraries (Redis caching, Google Sheets sync)
3. Build enhanced onboarding wizard
4. Create 1000+ Playwright tests
5. Deploy to production

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Remaining Time

- Dependencies + utilities: 1.5 hours
- Onboarding wizard: 2 hours
- Testing (1000+ tests): 4-5 hours
- Deployment + validation: 1 hour

**Total remaining**: ~8-9 hours

---

**STATUS**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSED - Waiting for Supabase schema execution

Once you've run the SQL, reply with "Schema done" and I'll continue immediately.
