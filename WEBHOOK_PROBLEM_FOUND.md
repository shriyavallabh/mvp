# üö® WEBHOOK PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED!

## Diagnostic Results

Just ran a complete diagnostic on your WhatsApp configuration. Here's what I found:

### ‚ùå PROBLEM 1: Phone-Level Webhook Override
**Your phone (+91 76666 84471) has its own webhook configuration**
- This OVERRIDES the WABA webhook completely
- All button clicks are going to the phone webhook, not your server

### ‚ùå PROBLEM 2: Messages Field Not Subscribed
**Even at WABA level, the "messages" field is NOT subscribed**
- Without this, button clicks won't be received
- This is CRITICAL for interactive messages

## Fix These Issues NOW

### Step 1: Remove Phone-Level Webhook

1. Go to Meta Business Manager
2. Navigate to: **WhatsApp Manager** ‚Üí **Phone Numbers**
3. Click on **Your Jarvis Daily Assistant (+91 76666 84471)**
4. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Configuration**
5. Look for **Webhook URL** section
6. **DELETE/REMOVE** any webhook URL configured here
7. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Configure at WABA Level Only

1. Go back to main **WhatsApp Manager**
2. Click **Settings** (at account level, NOT phone level)
3. Click **Webhooks**
4. Make sure NO phone number is selected in any dropdown
5. Configure:
   - Callback URL: `https://softball-one-realtor-telecom.trycloudflare.com/webhook`
   - Verify Token: `jarvish_webhook_2024`
   - mTLS: Keep OFF (unchecked)
6. Click **Verify and Save**

### Step 3: Subscribe to Messages Field

After saving the webhook:
1. You'll see a list of fields
2. Find **"messages"** field
3. If it shows "Subscribe", CLICK IT
4. It should change to "Unsubscribe" (meaning it's now subscribed)
5. Also subscribe to:
   - **message_status**
   - **message_template_status_update**

## Verification

After fixing, run this command to verify:
```bash
node check-webhook-hierarchy.js
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ No phone-level webhook
- ‚úÖ WABA webhook configured
- ‚úÖ "messages" field subscribed

## Test

I just sent a test button to your WhatsApp (919765071249).
After fixing the configuration:
1. Click the "Test Click" button
2. Check logs: `tail -f webhook.log`
3. You should see "BUTTON CLICK DETECTED!"

## Summary

Your button clicks aren't working because:
1. Phone-level webhook is intercepting all events
2. Messages field isn't subscribed

Fix both issues and button clicks will work immediately!
