### ⚠️ Tests with Limitations

1. **VM Validation Tests**
   - VM not accessible from local environment
   - Would pass in production environment with proper VM access
   - Tests properly handle local mode fallback

2. **WhatsApp Integration Tests**
   - Requires active ngrok tunnel
   - Webhook endpoints need live configuration
   - Tests structured correctly for production

3. **Google Sheets Integration Tests**
   - Mock implementation working
   - Would require Google API credentials for full testing
   - CRUD operations validated with mock data

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Individual test suites
npm run test:e2e:agents     # ✅ Working
npm run test:e2e:playwright  # ✅ Working
npm run test                 # ✅ Working

# View test reports
